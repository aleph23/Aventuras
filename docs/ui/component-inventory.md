# Component inventory

Build queue for the remaining UI primitives, app-domain compound
components, and layout shells. Tracks: what's shipped, what's specced
and ready to scaffold, what needs a design pass before building, and
what's deferred.

Sister to [`components.md`](./components.md) (construction
conventions), [`patterns/README.md`](./patterns/README.md) (pattern
specs), and [`../followups.md`](../followups.md) (decision-shaped
open items). This file is roadmap-shaped — entries leave the file
when they ship.

## States

- **shipped** — component file + story exist in the folder dictated
  by [components.md → Directory layout](./components.md#directory-layout).
- **needs-revision** — shipped, but the canonical contract evolved
  post-ship; code work is queued against the next implementation
  pass that touches the primitive (typically driven by a consumer
  needing the new capability). Entry leaves when the revision
  lands and the component re-enters `shipped` compliance.
- **build-ready** — pattern / foundation / per-screen doc fully
  specs the contract; no further design pass needed before
  scaffolding.
- **needs-design** — surface uses it or wireframe shows it, but
  there's no written contract yet. Run a design pass via
  [`aventuras-design`](../../.agents/skills/aventuras-design) before
  scaffolding.

## Primitives

Generic, single-purpose, reusable. Live in `components/ui/`.

### Primitives — shipped

Accordion, AlertDialog, Autocomplete, Avatar, Button, Checkbox,
Chip, ColorPicker, Dialog, EmptyState, Heading, Icon, IconAction, InlineEditableName,
Input, Popover, SearchableOverlayList, Select, Sheet, Skeleton, Spinner, Switch,
SwitchVisual, Tabs, Tag, Textarea, Text, Toast. Plus the `NativeOnlyAnimatedView`
utility wrapper.

### Primitives — needs revision

- **SearchableOverlayList** — add `initialScrollRowId`
  (open-time scroll-into-view) per the
  [substrate spec](./patterns/searchable-overlay-list.md#implementation-notes).
  Tracked in [`followups.md`](../followups.md#ux).
- **Sheet** — swap RN core `KeyboardAvoidingView` to
  `react-native-keyboard-controller`'s `KeyboardAvoidingView` (per
  [`overlays.md → Sheet — keyboard handling`](./patterns/overlays.md#sheet--keyboard-handling))
  once the library's Expo config plugin lands in `app.json` and the
  dev client is rebuilt. Tracked in
  [`followups.md`](../followups.md#ux).

### Primitives — build-ready

_Empty — every build-ready primitive has shipped._

### Primitives — needs design

_Empty — all primitives have specs._ As new primitive needs surface,
add rows here with the baseline column naming the react-native-reusables
source per [components.md → Sourcing](./components.md#sourcing--react-native-reusables-as-baseline)
(or `_none_` for from-scratch).

### Primitives — deferred

_Empty — no primitives currently blocked on a design decision._

Virtualization library choice is resolved (`@tanstack/react-virtual`
on web, `FlatList` on native) and validated inside Autocomplete's
suggestion list. A standalone `VirtualList` primitive isn't built:
the second consumer with materially different requirements
(reader narrative, with scroll-anchoring on above-viewport
mutations) will inform whether one shared primitive makes sense or
whether `NarrativeStream` should own its own virtualized shape.

## Compounds

Peer compositions of primitives. Domain-agnostic and
multi-domain compounds live in `components/compounds/`;
single-domain compounds live in `components/<domain>/`. Folder
column distinguishes per-row. See
[components.md → Directory layout](./components.md#directory-layout)
for the rule.

### Compounds — shipped

| Compound                   | Folder                  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CalendarPicker             | `components/compounds/` | Tier-adapted Select dropdown (rich two-line rows + `Manage in Vault →` tail) paired with an always-visible summary panel. Hosts: App Settings / Story Settings / Wizard. Layout `stacked` (default) vs `side-by-side`. Swap-warning AlertDialog (W1 / W2 / W3) intentionally out of scope — ships as a separate composition layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| CollisionListRow           | `components/compounds/` | Wraps shipped `ListRow` with a warn-tinted below-row collision strip carrying a `⚠ Collides with <other-name>` link and a `Resolve →` button. Strip is a sibling element outside the row's tap surface — own tap targets for link + button. World list-renderer's only call site at v1; pan-domain by contract so any future row-conditional warn extension can reuse the shape. Spec: [collision-resolve.md](./patterns/collision-resolve.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ActionsMenu                | `components/compounds/` | Universal command menu — a hybrid two-zone surface (curated global core and a screen-specific contextual zone) over a per-tier open surface (Popover desktop / Sheet phone). Trigger is the `⚲` top-bar icon plus `Cmd/Ctrl-K`. Composes `SearchableOverlayList`; combobox/listbox semantics, not a `role="menu"`. Spec: [actions-menu.md](./patterns/actions-menu.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| CollisionResolveDialog     | `components/compounds/` | Two-side collision resolution modal (Merge / Rename / Keep as distinct) for entity rows carrying `name_collision_flag`. Three body modes inline; merge body owns canonical pick + per-field radio + tag-deselect chips + relations summary; rename + keep bodies stateless or near-stateless. Pure View; Promise-driven `onResolve` driver wired by World consumer. Spec: [collision-resolve.md](./patterns/collision-resolve.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| DeltaLogRow                | `components/compounds/` | History-tab row across World, Plot, and the future global delta-log surface. Renders one `deltas` entry: op, target, field path, pre-rendered diff summary, source. Spec: [delta-log-row.md](./patterns/delta-log-row.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| EmbedderDownloadDialog     | `components/compounds/` | Three-payload install workflow modal (curated catalog / HF id / custom file import). Single canonical component invoked from Onboarding Step 4, App Settings · Embedding models · Add model, and Story Settings · Memory · Switch embedder. Pure View + reducer-driven container; ships with a stub driver. Real platform drivers wired per consumer. Spec: [embedder-download.md](./patterns/embedder-download.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| EntityKindIcon             | `components/entity/`    | 22×22 box, Lucide glyph centered (User / MapPin / Package / Flag). Color inherits via `TextClassContext`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| EntryCard                  | `components/compounds/` | Reader-composer narrative row. Renders all five entry kinds (`user`, `ai`, `opening`, `system`, `streaming`) as full-width bubbles with kind-keyed styling, conditional reasoning body, in-place edit, muted world-time footer. Spec: [entry-card.md](./patterns/entry-card.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FormRow                    | `components/compounds/` | Container-keyed stacked-vs-2-col layout (label / hint / error / required slot). Library-agnostic — caller pipes the error string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| GenerationStatusPill       | `components/compounds/` | Top-bar generation status pill (universal in-story chrome per [`principles.md → Universal in-story chrome`](./principles.md#universal-in-story-chrome)). Owns the priority machine (active generation > sticky error > hidden), maps phase + error enums to copy, renders tier-aware (icon-only on phone), and owns the click-to-cancel Popover for the active variant. Error variant taps fire `onErrorTap(code)` for the consumer to route. Spec: [generation-status-pill.md](./patterns/generation-status-pill.md).                                                                                                                                  |
| ImporterMenu               | `components/compounds/` | Trigger button + popover menu shell for `+ New X ▾` / `+ Add Y ▾` / `Import …` affordances. Renders only the menu chrome (label, options, disabled-reason); per-option actions are caller-supplied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| JSONViewer                 | `components/compounds/` | Tier-adapted Sheet (right drawer ≥ tablet, bottom sheet on phone) carrying `Raw JSON · <name>` header + Copy + ×, monospace pretty-printed body, disabled `Edit raw — coming later` footer. Read-only in v1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ListRow                    | `components/compounds/` | Pan-domain row carrying four indicator channels: lead-badge (slot), status-pill (slot), scene-presence (typed left-edge stripe), recently-classified (typed background-tint enum).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ProviderModelPicker        | `components/compounds/` | Searchable, grouped, rich-row picker for `{providerId, modelId}` composite. Composes `SearchableOverlayList` in `'in-overlay'` mode; trigger button (modelId + capability icons + chevron, with provider-missing / model-not-in-catalog warning variants), cross-provider Favorites pinned section, grouped provider sections with sticky headers, sticky-footer custom-add composer.

Bg derived from `--warning` at 12% via overlay-View (cross-platform). `⌘/Ctrl-S` shortcut on web only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| StoryCard                  | `components/compounds/` | Story List grid card. Single consumer; visual shape pinned in [story-list.md](./screens/story-list/story-list.md#story-card--text-first). Typed compound contract plus favorite-star visibility deviation from icon-actions. Spec: [story-card.md](./patterns/story-card.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| SuggestionCategoriesEditor | `components/compounds/` | Per-category editor list for next-turn suggestion categories. Per-row drag handle (dnd-kit sortable on web; native uses a custom reanimated + gesture-handler drag rendering plain Views — no virtualization, so the editor nests inside any ScrollView without warnings), enable toggle, label input (non-empty + case-insensitive unique with inline errors), `ColorPicker` swatch, prompt-hint textarea, delete. Phone collapses rows into an `Accordion`. Used by Story Settings → Composer and App Settings → Story Defaults. Spec: [story-settings.md → Suggestion categories](./screens/story-settings/story-settings.md#suggestion-categories). |
| SwitchRow                  | `components/compounds/` | Label + description + toggle, three-peer row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| TagInput                   | `components/compounds/` | Multi-value, iterative tag entry. Composes Tag + Input primitives into a bordered surface accumulating committed tags as removable chips alongside inline typing. Spec: [forms.md → TagInput pattern](./patterns/forms.md#taginput-pattern).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Toolbar                    | `components/compounds/` | List-pane chrome compound: search, filter chips, conditional sort, cross-tier overflow rule that wraps cleanly from desktop single-row to narrow stacked-rows. Spec: [toolbar.md](./patterns/toolbar.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Compounds — needs design

| Compound | Surfaces                                            | Open question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Importer | World / Plot per-row, Vault calendars, Story import | Full picker wrapper around `ImporterMenu` — file dialog (web `<input>` / native `expo-document-picker`), paste flow, zod-validated parse, error display, future Vault picker. Action surfaces per host differ enough that the wrapper shape needs a design pass before scaffolding. Deferred until more import groundwork lands. |

## Layout shells

Top-level layout primitives.

### Shells — shipped

| Shell              | Folder               | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DetailPane         | `components/shells/` | Master detail pane for World + Plot. Head (kind-breadcrumb + `nameSlot` + badges + ⋯) over a horizontal separator, then a `Tabs` strip and a scrollable body, with an optional `SaveBar` slot pinned to the bottom. Consumer wraps the pane in a single `<Tabs>` Root and splits strip / bodies across the `tabs` + `children` slots so the shell can visually anchor the strip below the head.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| EntityListPane     | `components/shells/` | Master list pane for World + Plot. Kind-selector row carries the minimalist `[+]` icon-action (replaces the prior footer `+ New <kind>` cell). Composes `Toolbar` for search / filter chips / optional sort; switches to a consumer-rendered `emptyState` slot when `isEmpty`. Row rendering and the kind-selector ReactNode are consumer territory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| MasterDetailLayout | `components/shells/` | Tier-aware 2-pane shell for World + Plot. tablet / desktop: side-by-side with `listPaneWidth` (default 340 px) + flex-1 detail and a vertical divider. phone (< 640 px via `useTier()`): list-first — `isRowSelected` toggles which pane is visible while both stay mounted so internal state (scroll, composer draft, dirty save-session) survives every transition per `collapse.md → State preservation`. Optional `subHeader` slot above the panes per `principles.md → Master-detail sub-header`. Spec: [collapse.md](./foundations/mobile/collapse.md), [layout.md](./foundations/mobile/layout.md), [principles.md](./principles.md#master-detail-sub-header). |
| ScreenShell        | `components/shells/` | Chrome wrapper — variant-driven (`app-root` / `app` / `in-story`). Owns left slot (Logo vs ← Return), variant-derived right cluster, token-progress strip (always rendered on `in-story` for layout stability), banner stack, and tier-aware reshuffle of reader chip cluster via `useTier()`. Page fills slots for title / status / extras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
