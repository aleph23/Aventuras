# Reader / Composer

**Wireframe:** [`reader-composer.html`](./reader-composer.html) — interactive

The core screen. Entry list + composer + streaming AI reply. Right
rail for world-state Browse. Chapter navigation + in-world time in
the top-bar chrome. Next-turn suggestions between entries and
composer.

Cross-cutting principles that govern this screen are in
[principles.md](../../principles.md). Relevant sections:

- [Top-bar design rule](../../principles.md#top-bar-design-rule)
- [Edit restrictions during in-flight generation](../../principles.md#edit-restrictions-during-in-flight-generation)
  (composer's send/cancel duality, status-pill click-to-cancel,
  disabled controls during a turn)
- [Composer mode — send-time transform](../../principles.md#composer-mode--send-time-transform-narration-aware)
- [Entity surfacing — three levels, same data](../../patterns/entity.md#entity-surfacing--three-levels-same-data)
  (Reader provides level 1 — Browse rail — and level 2 — peek drawer)
- [Entity row indicators — four channels](../../patterns/entity.md#entity-row-indicators--four-orthogonal-channels)
- [Browse filter chips + accordion grouping](../../patterns/entity.md#browse-filter-chips)
- [Empty list / table state + no-results state](../../patterns/lists.md#empty-list--table-state)
  (Browse rail inherits both: per-category empty placeholder when
  the active kind has no rows; "No results" line when search /
  filter narrows to zero)

## Top-bar — chapter navigation

Lean breadcrumb:

`<story-title ✎>  ·  <chapter-chip ▾>  ·  <time chip>`

**Progress strip** — thin 3px full-width bar along the bottom edge of
the top-bar. Fill width = current chapter's tokens / threshold.
Tooltip on hover shows exact numbers. Click opens chapter popover.

**Color thresholds** (apply to both the top-strip AND the popover
progress bar):

- **< 80%**: green (safe)
- **80–90%**: yellow (approaching — heads-up for manual-mode users)
- **≥ 90%**: red / warn (at limit — close imminent)

Why coloring matters: auto-chapter-close is a story setting; some
users wrap chapters manually. For them, the color is the primary
signal to close.

**Chapter popover contents:**

- **Chapter list** — closed chapters + the current one (labeled
  `in progress`, highlighted). Closed chapters click to jump.
- **Progress bar + label** — `chapter progress · 8,420 / 24,000 tok`
- **Close chapter manually** — primary action; opens the
  [chapter-close modal](../chapter-timeline/chapter-timeline.md#chapter-close-modal)
  to confirm the range and trigger the close sub-pipeline. Same
  modal is reachable from the
  [Chapter Timeline](../chapter-timeline/chapter-timeline.md) screen.
- **Manage chapters →** — link to the
  [Chapter Timeline](../chapter-timeline/chapter-timeline.md) screen
  for deeper chapter management (edit metadata, delete, regenerate
  summary, close with explicit end-entry pick).

Chapter closing is reachable from both the popover AND the Actions
menu.

## Top-bar — in-world time display

In-world time is rendered by the active calendar's renderer from the
latest entry's `metadata.worldTime` (physical seconds since story
start; calendar-uniform) plus the story's
`definition.worldTimeOrigin` — a `TierTuple` keyed by the active
calendar's tier names that anchors the elapsed seconds to a starting
point on the display tier-stack. See
[`calendar-systems/spec.md`](../../../calendar-systems/spec.md#calendar-definition)
for the primitive.

The renderer walks `worldTime + worldTimeOrigin` through the
calendar's tier stack to a tier-tuple, then renders via the
calendar's `displayFormat` Liquid template. Reader chrome treats
the rendered string as opaque; all calendar-specific shaping is
inside the template.

**Surfaces:**

- **Top-bar time chip** — small clock icon + label, after the chapter
  chip. Always visible. Renders the formatter's output as opaque
  text. `max-width: 260px` with ellipsis on overflow; full label in
  tooltip. Becomes interactive (click → popover) when the active
  calendar has surfaceable affordances; see
  [Time-chip popover](#time-chip-popover) below.
- **Chapter break (inline)** — each closed chapter's break in the
  entries list shows time at close (formatter applied to that
  chapter's `end_entry_id` worldTime).
- **Chapter popover rows** — each row shows a time range. Range
  endpoints are computed as `min(worldTime)` and `max(worldTime)`
  across the chapter's entries (excluding flashbacks with
  `worldTime = 0`), then formatted via the same formatter. The
  min/max computation keeps the range coherent even when manual
  `worldTime` edits put entries out of narrative order.

**The formatter is the only place "calendar" logic lives.** UI doesn't
parse, segment, or interpret the time string — it consumes whatever
the formatter returns. Future calendar systems plug in by replacing
the formatter; UI code is untouched.

Storage / classifier contract: see
[`data-model.md → In-world time tracking`](../../../data-model.md).

### Time-chip popover

The time chip becomes interactive when there are calendar-time
affordances to surface. Today: era flip on calendars where
`eras !== null`. The chip stays passive (no `▾` indicator, no
hover affordance, no popover) when nothing is surfacable — e.g.,
calendars with `eras: null` and no other affordances yet.

When interactive, click → small popover anchored to the chip:

```
┌── Day 12 · Reiwa 6 ──────────┐
│  Current era: Reiwa           │
│  [ Flip era…              ]  │
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Header** — the chip's rendered time, repeated for context.
- **Current era** — read-only `Current era: <name>` label;
  confirms what era is active (the era applied to the latest
  entry's `worldTime` per the calendar formatter). Hidden when
  the calendar has `eras: null`.
- **`Flip era…` action** — opens the
  [Flip era modal](#era-flip) anchored at the latest entry.
  Hidden when `eras: null`.

Symmetric with the chapter chip ▾ pattern: both chips become
interactive surfaces for their respective calendar-domain
concerns. The popover is the anchor point for future calendar-time
affordances (era flips today; other calendar-domain actions as
they land). Manual `worldTime` correction explicitly does NOT live
here — it's per-entry, on the
[world-time footer click](#per-entry-world-time-footer), so the
user is editing the entry whose time is wrong rather than
abstractly correcting "the latest entry" via top-bar chrome.

## Per-entry actions

Actions on an individual entry (edit, regenerate, branch, delete)
follow the
[icon-actions pattern](../../patterns/icon-actions.md) — icon
buttons, always-visible-but-muted, brighten on row hover/focus,
same affordance on desktop and mobile. The full per-kind action
matrix and rendering contract live in the
[EntryCard pattern](../../patterns/entry-card.md#action-cluster).

Icon set (placeholder glyphs per the
[shared glyph vocabulary](../../patterns/icon-actions.md#glyph-vocabulary);
finalize with visual identity):

| Action   | Glyph | Meaning                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| edit     | ✎     | Edit entry content                                                                                                                                |
| regen    | ↻     | Regenerate this AI reply                                                                                                                          |
| branch   | ⎇     | Branch from this entry — opens the [creation modal](./branch-navigator/branch-navigator.md#branch-creation--modal)                                |
| flip era | 📅    | Flip era from this entry — opens the [flip-era modal](#era-flip). Conditional: renders only when active calendar has eras.                        |
| probe    | 🔍    | Open the [memory probe](../memory-probe/memory-probe.md) for this turn. Conditional: renders only when probe mode is active at app + story level. |
| delete   | ×     | Delete this entry — opens the [rollback confirmation](./rollback-confirm/rollback-confirm.md) (cascade preview + counts modal)                    |

Per-entry action sets:

- **User entry:** edit, `[flip era]`, `[probe]`, delete
- **AI entry:** edit, regen, branch, `[flip era]`, `[probe]`, delete
- **System entry:** content-level buttons (Retry / Details / Dismiss)
- **Streaming entry:** no per-entry actions; cancel happens via the
  composer's Send→Cancel transform

Bracketed `[flip era]` and `[probe]` indicate conditional
visibility:

- `[flip era]` renders only when the active calendar has
  `eras !== null`. See [Era flip](#era-flip) below.
- `[probe]` renders only when probe mode is active at both
  `app_settings.diagnostics.enabled` and
  `stories.settings.probe_mode_active`. Off by default — the
  affordance is hidden, not greyed-out, to keep the daily-use
  reader uncluttered for users who don't tune. See
  [`memory-probe.md → Entry points → From reader-composer`](../memory-probe/memory-probe.md#from-reader-composer).
  Per-turn deep-mode capture is opted in via a separate small
  checkbox next to the composer's Send button when probe mode is
  on; it resets after one turn.

## Era flip

Era flips are user-triggered narrative events writing one row to
[`branch_era_flips`](../../../data-model.md#era-flips) — see
[`calendar-systems/spec.md → Eras`](../../../calendar-systems/spec.md#eras-hoisted-out-manually-triggered)
for what the underlying system models. This section covers the UI
surfaces that trigger a flip and the modal that captures the era
name.

**Trigger surfaces** (all conditional on `eras !== null`):

- **[Time-chip popover](#time-chip-popover) — `Flip era…` action.**
  Primary in-narrative path. Defaults the modal's anchor to the
  latest entry's `worldTime`.
- **[Actions menu](../../principles.md#actions--platform-agnostic-action-directory) — `Flip era…`.**
  Universal route. Same default anchor (latest entry).
- **Per-entry `📅 flip era` icon.** Defaults the anchor to the
  chosen entry's `worldTime` — covers the retcon case without
  needing the deferred entry-ref picker.

### Flip-era modal

```
┌──── Flip era ─────────────────────────── × ─┐
│                                              │
│   Flipping at entry 47 (Day 12, Reiwa 6).    │
│                                              │
│   Era name *                                 │
│   ┌────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│   │ Hei                                │     │
│   └────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│   ┌────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│   │ Heisei                             │     │
│   │ + Add new era: "Hei"               │     │
│   └────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│                                              │
│                       [ Cancel ]  [ Flip ]   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Width** ~400px. Centered. Backdrop dim.
- **Context line** — formatted via the active calendar's renderer
  on the chosen entry's `worldTime`. Read-only. Says "start of
  story" when `at_worldtime ≈ 0`.
- **Era name input** — uses the
  [Autocomplete-with-create primitive](../../patterns/forms.md#autocomplete-with-create-primitive)
  configured against `EraDeclaration.presetNames`. Casing
  normalization = canonical (commit form snaps to the preset's
  canonical case on case-insensitive match). Required;
  auto-focused on open.
- **`Flip` button** — disabled until input is non-empty
  (whitespace doesn't count). Enter inside the input also confirms,
  per the primitive's default Enter behavior.
- **`Cancel`** — closes; no row written. Esc and click-outside
  also Cancel.

**Collision guard.** `branch_era_flips` enforces unique
`(branch_id, at_worldtime)`. If the chosen anchor's `worldTime`
matches an existing flip's `at_worldtime` on the current branch,
the modal blocks save with an inline error pointing the user to
the existing flip's name and to the flip-list affordance in
[Story Settings · Calendar](../story-settings/story-settings.md#era-flips-on-this-branch)
where they can delete it.

**Confirmation.** No separate "are you sure" step. The modal's
form IS the confirmation. The time chip re-renders immediately
post-flip — that's the feedback. Reversible via CTRL-Z (one
delta).

**Edit-restrictions gating.** Every trigger surface and the modal's
`Flip` button disable when a pipeline transaction is in flight,
per
[`principles.md → Edit restrictions during in-flight generation`](../../principles.md#edit-restrictions-during-in-flight-generation).
Tooltip copy is principle-owned.

**Visibility.** All three trigger surfaces hide entirely when the
active calendar has `eras: null`. Browsing / cleanup of orphan
flips (when the calendar swap leaves a branch carrying flips that
the new calendar doesn't support) lives in
[Story Settings · Calendar → Era flips](../story-settings/story-settings.md#era-flips-on-this-branch)
— the trigger surfaces stay hidden regardless.

## Reasoning expansion + token metadata on AI entries

Reasoning text is persisted in
[`story_entries.metadata.reasoning?: string`](../../../data-model.md#entry-metadata-shape)
alongside the existing token counts; the brain-toggle expansion
re-shows the text post-stream from this field. The render contract
is owned by the
[EntryCard pattern](../../patterns/entry-card.md#reasoning-expansion);
this section covers the surface-specific shape of the meta line
and brain affordance.

Meta line is intentionally minimal. No model name — users don't care
per-entry. Format:

`📚  [🧠]  <reply-tok> / <reasoning-tok>`

- **Narrative glyph** (📚 placeholder, finalized in visual identity).
  Replaces a text "AI reply" label so the meta row stays compact at
  narrow widths and doesn't compete with the per-entry action cluster
  for horizontal space. Symbolizes the narrative voice / narrator
  rather than the AI provider.
- **Brain icon** (🧠 placeholder). Clickable — toggles an italic,
  muted, left-bordered reasoning body expansion **above** the content
  (chronological order: think, then speak). Absent when the provider
  doesn't expose reasoning tokens.
- **Unified token display** as `<reply> / <reasoning>` in muted
  monospace. Tooltip explains the slash.
- **Pulses** while the model is streaming reasoning (same animation
  as the gen-status pill dot). Static + clickable when done.
- **Collapsed by default**, including during the reasoning phase —
  click the pulsing brain to expand and watch reasoning stream.

## Per-entry world-time footer

Each `user`, `ai`, and `opening` entry carries a muted bottom-right
footer showing the entry's in-world time as a pre-formatted string
from the active calendar's renderer (same opaque-render contract
the [top-bar time chip](#top-bar--in-world-time-display) uses).
Hidden on `system` and `streaming` entries — system is generation
meta, streaming has no committed `worldTime` yet.

The footer reads `metadata.worldTime` through the active calendar's
formatter on the host side; the
[EntryCard pattern](../../patterns/entry-card.md#world-time-footer)
takes the formatted label opaque. Calendar formatter failure or a
calendar that omits per-entry display drops the footer cleanly via
an undefined label.

**Click-to-edit on AI / opening entries.** The footer is the
manual-correction surface for `metadata.worldTime`. Click opens an
edit overlay anchored to the footer with a `TierTupleInput` for the
active calendar; Save writes one `op=update` delta against
`entries.metadata.worldTime`. Host contract (props, render rules,
indicator behavior, cross-tier overlay shape):
[`entry-card.md → World-time footer`](../../patterns/entry-card.md#world-time-footer).
Design rationale, downstream-consumer tolerance contract, and the
no-cascade decision:
[`explorations/2026-05-17-manual-worldtime-correction.md`](../../../explorations/2026-05-17-manual-worldtime-correction.md).

The host (`reader-composer`) is responsible for computing the
monotonicity-break flag per entry (walk-back over the entries
collection, compare against the most recent preceding entry with
`worldTime > 0`) and passing `worldTimeMonotonicityBreak` to
EntryCard. The walk is O(N) per list render, cached against the
entries collection identity.

## Streaming entry — same structure, live state

The streaming AI entry uses the same structure as a completed AI
entry.

- **Reasoning phase:** brain icon pulses, token display `— / N →`
  (dash for reply-not-started, N = reasoning tokens so far).
  Reasoning body stays **collapsed by default**; pulsing brain is
  the signal. Content placeholder "reply hasn't started yet".
- **Reply phase:** brain icon static (reasoning complete), token
  display `M / N →` (M = reply streamed, N = final reasoning),
  content streams token-by-token.
- **Complete:** entry commits; trailing `→` disappears, brain
  clickable for reasoning expansion.

Non-reasoning providers: no brain, token display collapses to just
reply tokens.

## Error surface — system entries vs. persistent state pill

Two distinct surfaces handle two different kinds of failure:

### Transient pipeline failures — system entries in chat

Mid-turn pipeline errors (LLM call, embed call, classifier emit
that failed retries) render as **system-kind entries in the main
chat** — orange/warn-tinted bubbles with the failure description
and action buttons. Rationale: these errors need to be visible,
actionable, and part of the narrative log as context, not a silent
chrome blip.

| Failure                                                                                                                                                                          | Action buttons                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **LLM call failed**                                                                                                                                                              | `Retry` · `View details` · `Dismiss`                |
| **Embed call failed** mid-turn (the new-turn affordance disables until resolved per [`memory/retrieval.md → Compute lifecycle`](../../../memory/retrieval.md#compute-lifecycle)) | `Retry` · `Switch embedder` · `Roll back this turn` |
| **Narrative profile's provider missing** (pre-flight or resolver-time)                                                                                                           | `Fix profile` · `View details` · `Dismiss`          |
| **Assigned agent profile's provider missing** (pre-flight or resolver-time)                                                                                                      | `Fix profile` · `View details` · `Dismiss`          |
| **Agent has no profile assigned** (`assignments[agentId]` unset)                                                                                                                 | `Assign profile` · `View details` · `Dismiss`       |
| **Agent default model's provider missing**                                                                                                                                       | `Fix default` · `View details` · `Dismiss`          |

The embed-failure system entry follows the same visual shape as the
LLM-failure entry — the contract is "transient pipeline failure
that blocks turn completion until resolved." `Switch embedder`
routes to Story Settings · Memory · Switch and fires the
[Model swap UX](../../../memory/retrieval.md#model-swap-ux) dialog.
`Roll back this turn` reverse-replays the entire turn's deltas
through the
[rollback-confirm modal](./rollback-confirm/rollback-confirm.md).

The four **broken-reference** variants come from the pipeline's
[config pre-flight validation](../../../generation-pipeline.md#config-pre-flight-validation)
(caught before phase 0 fires — no deltas written, so no
`Roll back this turn` action), or, in the race case, from a
resolver-time failure mid-turn. The user can't distinguish which
layer caught it — same vocabulary either way. The
[deletion-semantics design](../../../data-model.md#app-settings-storage)
is what makes these resolver inputs go missing in the first place.
Action buttons route to the relevant settings surface: profile /
default / assignment. Per-story model overrides don't appear in
this table — they're pure model id strings per
[`story-settings.md → Models tab`](../story-settings/story-settings.md#models-tab--overrides-only),
and broken-model-catalog cases surface via the existing global
broken-config banner instead.

### Persistent state — top-bar status pill error variant

The top-bar status pill (per
[principles → Top-bar design rule](../../principles.md#top-bar-design-rule))
extends with an **error variant** for sticky state that can't be
dismissed by the next turn:

- **Embedding staleness** in this story (per
  [`memory/model-management.md → Staleness UI`](../../../memory/model-management.md#staleness-ui)).
  Pill copy: `Embedder offline — N rows pending`. Tap → routes to
  Story Settings · Memory's resolution panel.
- **Failed-persistent classifier** (per
  [`memory/classifier.md → Pill priority`](../../../memory/classifier.md#background-task-framing)).
  Pill copy: `Classifier offline — retrieval coverage thinning`.
  Tap → routes to Story Settings · Memory · Classifier panel.

Pill state precedence: active generation (narrative / chapter-
close / classifier) > error state > hidden. Sticky errors stay
visible between turns; once resolved, the pill collapses back to
hidden until the next event.

The error-pill is **not a new vocabulary** — it reuses the existing
gen-pill chrome with error-tinted styling instead of the active
animation. Single slot, multiple states, priority-ordered.

## Next-turn suggestions

After an AI reply completes, a **suggestions panel** appears between
the entries and the composer, offering 3-4 possible next turns. **UI
shape is unified** across modes; **category sets are mode-specific**
because adventure and creative frame the user differently.

**Categories per story mode:**

| Mode      | Categories                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Adventure | `Action`, `Dialogue`, `Examine`, `Move`     |

**Suggestions are complete prose.** Click → composer text fills with
the suggestion, composer mode is set to **`Free`** (suggestion is
already finished prose; no further wrapping needed). User can edit
text and/or override mode before sending.

**NOT coupled to composer mode categories.** Composer mode =
prefix/suffix wrapping intent. Suggestion category = narrative-beat
type. Different axes.

**Mix is classifier-driven**, not strict one-of-each.

**States:**

- `visible` — normal
- `loading` — suggestion LLM is regenerating (rows dim, regen icon
  pulses)
- `error` — generation failed (inline error with Retry)
- `collapsed` — user hid the list via chevron; chrome remains
- `hidden` — user disabled suggestions in Story Settings
  (`stories.settings.suggestionsEnabled = false`); panel never
  appears

## Scroll behavior

The entry list is log-shaped and unbounded; entries accumulate
within a branch, and the read pattern is recent-most-first. Three
mechanics compose: a single contiguous loaded window with auto-load
on scroll boundaries, autoscroll that follows AI streaming, and
jump buttons for terminal-endpoint navigation. The composed
fetching + virtualization pattern is documented at
[`patterns/lists.md → Composing virtualization with load-older`](../../patterns/lists.md#composing-virtualization-with-load-older);
this section covers the reader-specific behaviors layered on top.

### Loaded-set model

At any moment the reader holds a **single contiguous window** of
entries — never two disconnected windows.

**Window.** The contiguous range in memory + DOM. On branch open:
~50 most recent entries. Inside the window, only visible rows +
small overscan render to DOM (virtualization).

**Auto-load on scroll boundary.** As the user scrolls within the
window:

- Approaching the top of the loaded range (within ~one
  viewport-height of the topmost loaded entry) → auto-fetch the
  next older chunk (~50 entries). Content prepends; the user's
  apparent scroll position must stay anchored (see
  [Anchor preservation under shifts](#anchor-preservation-under-shifts)
  for the cross-platform implementation requirement).
- Approaching the bottom of the loaded range (within ~one
  viewport-height of the bottommost loaded entry, when that isn't
  the live edge) → auto-fetch the next forward chunk. Content
  appends.

Loading shimmer at the boundary edge during fetch — fast scrollers
don't hit empty space. This is the reader's deviation from
[`lists.md → Load-older`](../../patterns/lists.md#load-older--log-shaped-unbounded-lists)'s
explicit-click rule. The existing rule applies to History-tab-shaped
surfaces where auto-loading older content while glancing at recent
state would be a surprise; the reader's auto-load fires only on
**boundary approach** — the user explicitly asking for more in
that direction.

**Swap on jump.** When the user invokes
[jump-to-top or jump-to-bottom](#jump-buttons) to a region not
adjacent to the current window, the entire window swaps:

- Jump-to-top → unload current, fetch entries 1..50 of the branch,
  render. Instant cut to entry 1 in viewport.
- Jump-to-bottom from a non-recent window → unload current, fetch
  entries `last-49..last`, render. Instant cut to bottom.
- Jump-to-bottom while already in the recent window → smooth scroll
  (~150ms) to bottom. No swap.

**Scroll-position restoration per window.** Each branch has up to
two remembered scroll positions — one for the recent window, one
for the top window (if either has been visited this session). Save
the current window's `scrollTop` before unloading; restore on
return. Without it, the swap loses the user's place every time
they peek at the start. Positions reset on branch switch.

**"Branch top" semantics.** First entry of the **current branch** —
first post-fork entry on a non-root branch, or entry #1 of the root
branch. The reader does not walk fork chains across branches.
Cross-branch navigation is the
[Branch navigator](./branch-navigator/branch-navigator.md)'s
domain.

**Branch switch.** Resets the window to the recent ~50 entries of
the new branch, scrolled to bottom. Saved scroll positions for the
previous branch are dropped.

### Autoscroll

Per-stream state machine: **engaged** ↔ **disengaged**, with
auto-re-engagement on return to bottom.

**Engage condition (per stream).** When an AI reply begins streaming,
autoscroll evaluates whether the viewport is at-bottom (within ~80px
tolerance):

- At bottom → engaged. Viewport pins to streaming entry's bottom
  edge as tokens arrive.
- Not at bottom → disengaged. Streaming entry grows below the fold;
  user keeps their position.

The ~80px tolerance is generous because the suggestion-panel +
composer chrome sits below the entries.

**Disengage.** Any user-initiated scroll upward during a stream →
disengaged for the rest of the stream. Detection: track `scrollTop`
set by autoscroll programmatically; if a `scroll` event reports a
different value, it's user-initiated.

**Re-engage (auto).** User scrolls back to within ~80px of bottom
while still in the same stream → autoscroll re-engages. Viewport
pins back to streaming entry's bottom.

**Stream end.** Engaged / disengaged state resets. Next stream
re-evaluates the engage condition fresh.

**Layout shifts during a stream.**

- **Reasoning body expansion on an earlier entry** — document grows
  above viewport; native browser scroll-anchoring keeps visible
  content stable. The chosen virtualization library MUST preserve
  scroll-anchoring on above-viewport mutations (per
  [`lists.md → Library choice`](../../patterns/lists.md#library-choice)).
- **Suggestion panel appearing at stream end** — adds ~80px between
  last entry and composer. Engaged: viewport stays at the new
  bottom (engagement carries through the layout shift). Disengaged
  - above tolerance: panel doesn't move them.

**Streaming while in a non-recent window.** Pipeline writes happen
in the data layer regardless of which window is rendered. The
streaming entry is at the live edge — outside the loaded window
when the user has jumped to top. Render simply doesn't show it
until the user returns to the recent window. The chrome status pill
(per
[`principles.md → Universal in-story chrome`](../../principles.md#universal-in-story-chrome))
is the cross-window awareness signal that something is in flight.
Render reattaches when the user returns; token append continues
into the now-mounted entry.

**Edit-restrictions.** Scroll is a read action. Per
[`principles.md → What's not gated`](../../principles.md#whats-not-gated),
autoscroll, jump buttons, and auto-load fetches are all unaffected
by the in-flight transaction gate.

### Jump buttons

Two floating affordances in the scroll viewport, stacked vertically
near the right edge, above the suggestion panel + composer chrome.

**Visibility — conditional.**

- **Jump-to-bottom** — visible when the user is not at-bottom of
  the recent window, OR when the current window is not the recent
  window. Slides in / out on threshold cross.
- **Jump-to-top** — visible when (a) the
  [`Show jump-to-top button` App Settings toggle](../app-settings/app-settings.md#show-jump-to-top-button)
  is on AND (b) the current window is not the top window OR the
  user is not scrolled to entry 1 within it. Hidden otherwise.

**Click behavior.**

- **Jump-to-bottom.** In the recent window: smooth scroll (~150ms)
  to bottom. In the top window: swap (unload top, load recent),
  instant cut to bottom of recent. Re-engages autoscroll if a
  stream is in flight and the user lands at-bottom.
- **Jump-to-top.** In the top window already loaded: smooth scroll
  to entry 1. In the recent window: swap (unload recent, load
  entries 1..50), instant cut to entry 1.

The swap path is always instant cut — there's no in-between content
to traverse smoothly. The same-window path is smooth.

**Keyboard shortcuts** (always available regardless of toggle):

- `Home` — jump-to-top
- `End` — jump-to-bottom

**Actions menu entries** (always available):

- `Jump to top of branch`
- `Jump to bottom`

The App Settings toggle gates the visible button only, never the
capability — keyboard and Actions remain on regardless.

**Chapter-top is not a separate scroll button.** The chapter chip in
the [top-bar — chapter navigation](#top-bar--chapter-navigation)
already exposes per-chapter jumps via the chapter popover.
Scroll-chrome buttons stay focused on terminal endpoints (top /
bottom of branch); chapter-anchored navigation lives with chapter
chrome.

### Anchor preservation under shifts

Three content-shift scenarios can push above-the-fold content
without the user asking for it; in all three, the user's apparent
scroll position must stay anchored — content above the fold can
shift, but what's in front of the user must not jump.

- **Prepend on auto-load older.** A `~50`-entry block prepends
  above the viewport when the user nears the top of the loaded
  range.
- **Reasoning body expansion above the fold.** An entry above the
  current scroll has its reasoning region toggled open (whether by
  the user or via remount).
- **World-time footer label re-render.** A manual world-time edit
  on an entry above the fold can change the footer label's pixel
  width, wrapping or de-wrapping the footer row.

**Native (FlatList) — `maintainVisibleContentPosition`** handles
all three transparently at the FlatList level. No additional glue.

**Web (`@tanstack/react-virtual`)** does NOT preserve native
browser scroll-anchoring across prepend or in-place height
changes. The implementation measures the prepended (or expanded)
block, adds equivalent top padding before the layout commit,
scrolls by the same delta, then drops the padding on the next
frame. Validate against a real prepend stream once
reader-composer is wired against live data.

## Browse rail — collapse / expand

The rail is collapsible to give the narrative full prose width and
to reduce chrome during pure reading. It also adapts to small
Electron windows (responsive auto-collapse below a viewport
threshold) without committing to a mobile shape.

### Collapsed state — compact persistent dashboard

Collapsed, the rail squeezes to a vertical strip on the screen's
right edge (~28–32px wide; precise value finalized in the visual
identity pass — the mobile foundation docs already reference 28
px). The strip is **not** a passive silhouette: it carries a
compact information dashboard that doubles as the classifier-
awareness surface, with the expand affordance called out
explicitly so the strip reads as interactive at a glance.

Vertical anatomy, top to bottom:

1. **Affordance chevron.** A small inward-pointing `‹` at
   top-center, full opacity (independent of any muted hover-
   baseline). Geometrically mirrors the `›` collapse trigger in
   the expanded rail's header. Always visible — the strip's
   "expandable" affordance is explicit, not inferred from a
   silhouette.
2. **Group A — counted cells.** Characters and Items. Each cell
   renders the
   [kind glyph](../../patterns/entity.md#entity-kind-indicators--icons-not-text)
   plus a count of that kind's rows in the latest entry's
   `metadata.sceneEntities`. Count `0` renders with muted text;
   counts greater than 9 render as `9+` to keep cell width
   stable.
3. **Group separator.** A small vertical gap (~4–6px) telegraphs
   "different unit below" between counted and quick-access cells.
   Visual identity may promote the gap to an explicit hairline if
   real-world rendering reads it as accidental.
4. **Group B — quick-access cells.** Location and Factions. Glyph
   only, no count. `currentLocationId` is a 0-or-1 singleton —
   the count would be the same value for the whole story past the
   initial scene; factions are not scene-tagged per
   [`data-model.md → Entry metadata shape`](../../../data-model.md#entry-metadata-shape),
   so a faction count is undefined.
5. **Empty clickable region** filling the remaining strip height.

**Per-cell classifier-tint composition.** Every cell, both
groups, carries the per-kind tint. Cell tint strength equals the
highest strength of any row of that kind currently in the
recently-classified window — fresh if any contributor is fresh,
fading if all contributors are fading-only, untinted when all
have aged out. Mirrors the
[row-tint decay rule](../../patterns/entity.md#recently-classified-row-accent)
exactly; same `--recently-classified-bg` slot, no new color
tokens. Cell aggregation reads the rail's current row set —
deleted rows contribute nothing, so a cell naturally untints if
all contributors leave (no phantom tint with nothing tinted
underneath when the user expands). Glyph and count keep
full-strength contrast over the tint; legibility is the
constraint.

**Click semantics — three hit zones.**

- **Affordance chevron** — expand rail, preserve current
  category. Tooltip: `Expand rail`.
- **Cell** — expand rail **and** switch its category to that
  kind. Tooltip: `<Kind> in scene: <count>` for Group A;
  `<Kind>` for Group B.
- **Empty region** — expand rail, preserve current category.

Hover decoration brightens per zone independently — cells aren't
brightened by hovering empty area, and vice versa. Cell tints
from classifier activity remain stable on hover (tint is
information; hover is interaction feedback — distinct
primitives). The existing `Cmd/Ctrl+\` shortcut continues to
toggle expand / collapse without strip-internal keyboard
traversal.

On tablet (inheriting desktop), the same hit zones become tap
targets. Tooltip disclosure surfaces via long-press per the
[touch.md → Tap-to-tooltip on inert chrome text](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#tap-to-tooltip-on-inert-chrome-text)
pattern. Cells fall under the 44-px iOS recommended hit-target;
a tap-miss lands on the chevron or empty region (both also
expand) — worst case is "expand without category-switch," no
destructive cost.

### Open state — collapse trigger

A small chevron (`›`) in the rail header's top-right corner
collapses the rail. The chevron points toward the right edge to
telegraph the motion. Tooltip: `Collapse rail`.

Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd/Ctrl+\` (toggles regardless of focus
location, mirroring VSCode's sidebar shortcut).

No top-bar slot for the toggle. The back button stays in its
existing rightmost position, and the right-edge spatial gravity
belongs to the rail itself, not to the chrome cluster.

### State model — manual + viewport, decoupled

Two inputs combine to determine display:

- **Manual preference** — set by the chevron, the strip, or the
  keyboard shortcut. Persists app-globally across launches (not
  per-story, not per-session).
- **Viewport-forced collapse** — fired by resize events crossing
  a width threshold downward. Overrides display without
  overwriting manual preference.

```
on user toggle (chevron / strip / shortcut):
  manual_preference = (toggle); apply immediately

on resize crossing threshold downward (viewport < ~900px):
  display = collapsed (manual_preference unchanged)

on resize crossing threshold upward (viewport > ~980px,
~80px hysteresis):
  display = manual_preference (restore)
```

Viewport check is **event-driven** (one-shot on threshold cross),
not a continuous constraint. A continuous constraint would
silently re-collapse the rail every time a user clicks the strip
in a small window. Decoupling lets the user explicitly expand the
rail in a cramped window and accept the squeeze.

Threshold pixel values (~900 / ~980 with ~80px hysteresis) are
tunable in the visual identity pass; the **rule shape** —
event-driven, hysteresis-buffered, manual preference preserved
underneath — is what's locked here.

First-launch default: **open**. Storage venue is implementation
detail (an ergonomic UI-state surface, not `stories.settings` —
this is chrome state, not story content).

### Peek drawer — peek implies rail open

The peek drawer is invoked only by clicking rail rows in the
expanded rail (per
[Peek drawer](#peek-drawer--lead-affordance-for-characters)).
Peek and collapsed-rail are mutually exclusive states:

- Open + click rail row → peek slides in over rail + narrative
  (status quo).
- Collapsed → no path to invoke peek without first expanding.

Collapsing the rail (manually or via viewport-forced collapse)
while peek is open closes the peek simultaneously. They're a
continuum: peek is a deeper state of "rail engaged," collapse is
"rail dismissed." Closing the container closes its contents.

### Animation

~150ms symmetric horizontal slide (ease-out collapse, ease-in
expand). The rail and the strip are visually a continuum — no
fade, no separate elements appearing. The narrative column's
right edge slides left/right in lockstep.

## Browse rail — search scope

Search is **category-aware** — scope changes with the active
category in the dropdown:

- **Characters / locations / items / factions** (entity rows):
  `name`, `description`, `tags`
- **Lore**: `title`, `body`, `category`, `tags`
- **Threads**: `title`, `description`, `category`, `tags`
- **Happenings**: `title`, `description`, `category`, `tags`

Placeholder text rotates with the active category
(`Search characters…` / `Search lore…` / etc.) — reader-specific
deviation; standard tooltip + ⓘ affordances per the
[search-bar-scope pattern](../../patterns/lists.md#search-bar-scope).

## Peek drawer — lead affordance for characters

The peek-head exposes the lead-character mutation inline (no overflow
menu — peek is intentionally lightweight; deep work routes to the
World panel via the existing `Open in World panel →` foot link).

For a character peek:

- **Currently lead** — small badge after the name reading `You`
  (adventure mode) / `Protagonist` (creative). Same `lead-badge`
  styling used in the Browse rail row, so the indicator is uniform
  wherever a character is surfaced.
- **Not lead** — small inline `Set as lead` text-action after the
  name. Click sets `stories.definition.leadEntityId` to this entity;
  the peek transitions to the badge state in place.

For non-character kinds (location / item / faction / lore / threads /
happenings) the peek-head is unchanged — the affordance does not
apply.

No confirmation modal. Lead-switching is a first-class action per
[principles → Mode, lead, and narration](../../principles.md#mode-lead-and-narration--three-orthogonal-concepts);
the reader's narration and `You` anchor immediately re-anchor to the
new lead, which IS the feedback (consistent with the no-toast
precedent in the
[branch creation flow](./branch-navigator/branch-navigator.md#after-confirm)).

### State-field composition — same as World panel Overview

The peek body's content is a 440px-width projection of the
[Overview tab](../world/world.md#overview--glance-summary-read-mostly)
from the World panel. Per-kind glance composition lives there;
peek doesn't restate it. Single design, two surfaces.

This includes the [non-default `injection_mode` chip](../world/world.md#overview--glance-summary-read-mostly)
that lives on Overview — it propagates to peek for free via the
projection rule. No separate spec for the peek surface.

### State-field composition — lore peek

Lore has no Overview tab (per
[`world.md → Lore — separate kind`](../world/world.md#lore--separate-kind)),
so the entity-side projection rule doesn't apply. The lore peek
body is a read-only projection of the **Body tab + non-default
operational signals from Settings**, top-down at 440px width:

- **Operational chip row** — renders only when there are
  non-default signals to surface:
  - **Injection-mode chip** when `always` or `disabled` (hidden
    for `keyword_llm` default). Same chip shape used on entity
    Overview.
  - **Category chip** when set. Distinct visual treatment from
    the injection chip — content tag, not operational signal.
- **Body prose** — read-only render of `lore.body`. **Truncates
  at ~10 visible lines** with `…` ellipsis; the foot link is the
  escalation path for full read. Empty body cannot occur (per
  [`world.md → Required body`](../world/world.md#required-body--creation--edit-invariant)).
- **Tags chip row** — read-only mirror of the Settings `tags`
  field.

What's not on lore peek:

- No `priority` — peek surfaces user-actionable signals, not
  internal retrieval scaffolding.
- No inline editing — peek-head's lead-character mutation is
  character-only and doesn't apply.
- No History — log access stays on the World panel.

Peek is read-mostly. The lead-character mutation above is the only
inline mutation surface (character-only; doesn't apply to lore or
other non-character kinds). Deep edits route to the World panel
via the existing `Open in World panel →` foot link.

## Mobile expression

Renders per the
[mobile foundations contracts](../../foundations/mobile/README.md).
Reader is a 2-pane surface that collapses to 1-pane on phone per
[`collapse.md → Reader / composer`](../../foundations/mobile/collapse.md#reader--composer-narrative--rail--narrative--rail-strip).
Tablet inherits desktop verbatim per
[navigation.md → Tablet](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#tablet-6401023-px);
the existing rail viewport-forced-collapse threshold (~900 px per
[State model](#state-model--manual--viewport-decoupled)) covers
phone-landscape and iPad-portrait, so iPad-portrait already gets
the strip-collapsed rail without a phone-specific rule. Phone-tier
specifics below.

- **Top-bar shape.** Slim single-row plus reader-only chip strip
  per
  [navigation.md → Phone top-bar](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#phone--640-px).
  Layout: `[←] [story-title…] [status-pill] [⛭] [⚲]`. Story title
  truncates with ellipsis; tap reveals the full title in a transient
  popover per
  [touch.md → Tap-to-tooltip on inert chrome text](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#tap-to-tooltip-on-inert-chrome-text).
- **Reader chip strip (phone-only).** Below the top-bar:
  `[Chapter ▾] [<time chip>] [⎇N] ········· [☰ Browse]`.
  Horizontally scrollable when overflowing; ~16 px left padding
  doubles as iOS swipe-back safe zone per
  [touch.md → Chip-strip safe zone](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#chip-strip-safe-zone).
  The Browse chip is **right-anchored** within the strip — it's
  an action affordance (opens the rail content as a Sheet), not a
  state chip; the visual separation telegraphs the difference.
- **Chapter chip popover** binds to **Sheet (medium, bottom)** on
  phone per
  [layout.md → Surface bindings](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#surface-bindings--existing-app-surfaces)
  — multi-row content (chapter list, progress bar, manage-chapters
  link) exceeds the tiny-popover threshold.
- **Time chip popover** stays Popover all tiers — tiny content
  (era label and `Flip era…` action).
- **Branch chip popover** binds to **Sheet (short, bottom)** on
  phone; primitive specced in
  [branch-navigator → Mobile expression](./branch-navigator/branch-navigator.md#mobile-expression).
- **Status pill on phone** is icon-only (the desktop label
  `reasoning…` doesn't fit narrow chrome). Tap reveals current
  phase plus cancel in a Popover anchored to the pill per
  [touch.md → Status pill on phone](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#status-pill-on-phone).
  Same cancel-pipeline flow as desktop.
- **Browse rail not visible in-place on phone.** Phone width is a
  strict subset of the existing viewport-forced-collapse threshold
  (~900 px), and the right-edge strip — a desktop-shaped folded-
  rail affordance — translates poorly to phone (right-edge trigger
  → bottom-anchored sheet creates a directional mismatch). On
  phone the rail column is hidden; **the `[☰ Browse]` chip in
  the chip strip is the trigger** — bottom-anchored chip opens
  the rail's content as a bottom Sheet. Tier-aware per
  [collapse.md → Reader / composer](../../foundations/mobile/collapse.md#reader--composer-narrative--rail--narrative--rail-strip):
  desktop / tablet keep the right-edge strip and expand the rail
  in place; **phone uses the chip and a Sheet (bottom, medium
  initial)**.
- **Browse chip classifier-awareness tint.** The chip background
  tints with `--recently-classified-bg` whenever any row across
  any rail-surfaceable category (characters, locations, items,
  factions, lore, threads, happenings) has classifier activity
  in the current fresh-or-fading window. Two-state decay mirrors
  the
  [row-tint rule](../../patterns/entity.md#recently-classified-row-accent):
  full strength on the turn of write, 50% strength on the
  following turn, gone after. Single aggregate signal — no
  per-kind disambiguation on phone (the chip is too small;
  per-kind discovery surfaces inside the rail-as-Sheet via the
  existing row tint once the user taps in). The chip's tap
  behavior, label, and the rail-as-Sheet flow are unchanged;
  tint is purely informational, no tooltip or long-press
  disclosure added.
- **Rail-as-sheet contents.** Full rail vocabulary — category
  dropdown, filter chips, search, row list, Import affordance.
  Tap a row inside the sheet → sheet swaps to peek view (height
  may grow to tall ~85–95 % per the
  [Peek drawer mapping](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#mapping--desktop-to-mobile)).
  Single sheet, content state-swap; not Sheet over Sheet (which
  is disallowed per
  [layout.md → Stacking](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#stacking)).
  In peek state, the sheet head shows an **icon-only `←`** back
  affordance at the top-left — replaces the desktop `×` (which
  is desktop chrome; sheets dismiss via handle / backdrop, not
  an X). The arrow is the universal back affordance, no text
  label needed; the head uses flex-start so entity meta sits
  close after the arrow. Tap returns to row-list state. Peek's `Open in panel →` link dismisses the
  sheet and routes to World / Plot per the cross-surface nav
  model. Drag-down on the handle, or backdrop tap, dismisses the
  whole sheet regardless of state.
- **Peek-rail mutual exclusion** (per
  [Peek drawer — peek implies rail open](#peek-drawer--peek-implies-rail-open))
  holds on phone — peek is reachable only via row-tap inside the
  rail-as-sheet, never independently. The desktop "collapse
  closes peek" rule maps to "drag-down dismisses sheet
  regardless of state."
- **Composer keyboard handling.** `KeyboardAvoidingView` per
  [platform.md → Keyboard avoidance](../../foundations/mobile/platform.md#keyboard-avoidance)
  reflows narrative and composer above the soft keyboard. The
  narrative scroll view shrinks; latest entry stays at the top of
  the visible scroll region per the existing scroll-behavior
  rule. Composer textarea sits directly above the keyboard; send
  button and mode picker remain visible. Suggestion panel moves
  up with the composer (it's content, not chrome).
- **Per-entry action icons** stay always-visible-muted per the
  [icon-actions visibility rule](../../patterns/icon-actions.md#visibility--always-rendered-color-tiered-brighten-on-hover);
  no tier-specific change. Touch users see the icons at the muted
  default; taps trigger normally.
- **Modals stay Modal all tiers** — branch creation, rollback
  confirm, era flip, chapter close. Per the layout binding table.
- **Stack-aware Return.** The chrome `←`, Android `BackHandler`,
  and iOS swipe-back all bind to stack-aware Return per
  [navigation.md → Stack-aware Return on mobile](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#stack-aware-return-on-mobile).
  Empty-stack-confirm is Android-relevant primarily per
  [platform.md → OS back integration](../../foundations/mobile/platform.md#os-back-integration).
- **Safe areas.** Top-bar honors `insets.top`; composer and send
  button area honor `insets.bottom`; narrative scroll extends
  edge-to-edge but its visible end-of-scroll respects the bottom
  inset per
  [platform.md → Safe areas](../../foundations/mobile/platform.md#safe-areas).

## Screen-specific notes

- Title max-width capped at 320px with ellipsis + tooltip; keeps long
  titles from blowing out the header.
- Progress strip is **always visible**, color-graded by threshold.
- Suggestions panel appears between entries and composer (below the
  last entry, above the composer).
- Clicking a suggestion fills composer text + sets mode=`Free`.
- Entry hover reveals per-entry action icons at full opacity (they
  exist at 55% by default).
- Chapter break inline separators are minimalist (thin rule + chapter
  label + time at close).
- Per-chapter in-world time shows as a range in the popover (closed
  chapters) or "since <time>" (current chapter).
