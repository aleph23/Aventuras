# Chapter Timeline

**Wireframe:** [`chapter-timeline.html`](./chapter-timeline.html) — interactive

The dedicated chapter management surface. Reached from the reader's
top-bar chapter popover via the `Manage chapters →` link.

The reader's chapter popover handles **glance + jump + simple
close**. This screen handles everything richer: viewing the
LLM-generated metadata (summary, theme, keywords), editing it,
closing the current chapter with explicit end-entry picking, and
deleting a chapter (which routes through rollback).

Cross-cutting principles that govern this screen are in
[principles.md](../../principles.md). Relevant sections:

- [Save-session pattern](../../patterns/save-sessions.md) — per-card
  edit session, navigate-away guard fires when expanding another
  card with unsaved changes.
- [Icon-actions pattern](../../patterns/icon-actions.md) — for
  per-row edit affordances.
- [Edit restrictions during in-flight generation](../../principles.md#edit-restrictions-during-in-flight-generation) —
  card edits and the `Close chapter…` action disable while a
  generation pipeline is in flight; the chapter-close pipeline
  itself surfaces the banner affordance specified in the principle.
- [Actions menu (contextual zone)](../../patterns/actions-menu.md#contextual-zone) —
  Chapter Timeline contributes close / re-open / chapter-jump
  commands to the universal `⚲` directory.

```

Vertical timeline of cards stacked top-to-bottom, ordered by
`sequence_number` ascending. The in-progress chapter renders as a
specialized last card (no DB row exists for it yet — see
[data-model → Chapters / memory system](../../../data-model.md#chapters--memory-system)).

## Per-chapter card

### Collapsed state

Default state for non-active cards. Single row showing:

- **Number + title** — `Chapter <N> — <title>` with a `▸`
  expand-disclosure on the right.
- **Compact metadata line** — `<time range> · <token count> ·
<theme>`. Theme renders as plain text, comma-separated; not chips.

Click anywhere on the card body → expand. Same row click on an
already-expanded card → collapse.

### Expanded state

The full editor. **One card expanded at a time** — expanding
another card with the current one dirty fires the
[navigate-away guard](../../patterns/save-sessions.md#navigate-away-guard--global-intercept)
(Save / Discard / Cancel).

Editable fields (zod-validated; types per
[data-model → chapters](../../../data-model.md)):

- **Title** (`title`) — single-line text input.
- **Theme** (`theme`) — single-line text input. Free-form short
  thematic tag.
- **Summary** (`summary`) — multi-line textarea, 4–6 visible rows.
  This is the load-bearing field; gets the most space.
- **Keywords** (`keywords`) — chip editor. Add new chip via inline
  input; remove via per-chip `×`. Keywords drive retrieval / LLM
  injection per the data-model.

Read-only context shown alongside (not part of the form):

- **Time range** — `<start time> – <end time>` formatted via the
  active calendar formatter.
- **Token count** — accumulated `token_count` across the chapter.
- **Closed at** — wall-clock `closed_at` timestamp, muted small.
- **Entry range** — `start_entry_id` → `end_entry_id`, displayed as
  entry numbers (e.g. `entries 12–34`).

### Per-card actions

Three buttons in a row beneath the form, before the save bar:

- **Jump to chapter →** — routes back to the reader scrolled to the
  chapter's start entry. The reader's chapter chip would highlight
  the same chapter on arrival. No state mutation.
- **Regenerate summary** — re-runs only the LLM metadata-generation
  step (title / summary / theme / keywords) on the chapter's
  existing range. Idempotent for the metadata layer; does NOT
  re-run lore-management (that's a destructive re-application and
  out of scope for v1 — see
  [open questions](#screen-specific-open-questions)). Confirm modal
  warns "this overwrites the current title/summary/theme/keywords."
- **Delete…** — destructive. Opens the
  [rollback-confirm modal](../reader-composer/rollback-confirm/rollback-confirm.md)
  pre-targeted at the chapter's `start_entry_id`. Deleting the
  chapter means rolling back to before the chapter's start; the
  rollback flow already handles cascade + cross-chapter warnings.

### Save session — per card

Each card is its own
[save session](../../patterns/save-sessions.md). First field edit
opens the session; the in-card save bar appears at the card's
bottom edge (`Discard` / `Save` per the pattern). Save commits all
session changes under one `action_id`; CTRL-Z reverses the entire
edit.

In-card save bar (vs screen-bottom): each chapter is a self-
contained edit surface, so the save bar belongs with the card it
applies to. If a user scrolls away from a dirty card, scrolling
back is the way to commit — there's no global "save dirty card"
chrome at the screen edge.

## In-progress chapter card

The current open region renders as a specialized last card. No DB
row exists for it (per data-model: chapters are persisted only on
close), so most fields are placeholders.

Rendered:

- **Title row** — `── In progress · since <start time> ──` (no
  chapter number; the next number lands at close).
- **Token progress** — `<current> / <threshold> tok` plus a thin
  progress bar. Color-graded per the same thresholds the reader's
  top-strip uses (per
  [reader-composer → Top-bar chapter navigation](../reader-composer/reader-composer.md#top-bar--chapter-navigation)):
  green < 80%, yellow 80–90%, red ≥ 90%.
- **Summary placeholder** — italic muted "summary generates on
  close."
- **Action: Close chapter…** — primary button. Opens the
  [chapter-close modal](#chapter-close-modal) below.

The card is not expandable / editable — there's nothing to edit
yet. Once the user closes the chapter, the in-progress card is
replaced by a new closed-chapter card at the bottom of the
timeline, expanded by default so the user can review (and edit, if
they want to override) the LLM-generated metadata.

## Chapter-close modal

Triggered from two places: this screen's `Close chapter…` button
**and** the reader's chapter popover `Close chapter manually`
button. Same modal, same shape — uniform UX.

```
┌──── Close current chapter? ──────────────────── × ─┐
│                                                      │
│  Closes the open chapter from entry 89 through       │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Width** ~480px. Centered. Backdrop dim.
- **Title** — `Close current chapter?` Entry-agnostic on purpose:
  the user picks the end entry inside the modal, so naming a
  specific entry up front would be presumptuous of the default.
- **Body** — one-sentence framing + start-entry row + end-entry
  picker + live token count.
- **Foot** — `Cancel` (secondary) + `Close chapter` (primary, ink —
  this is constructive, not destructive). Esc and click-outside
  cancel.

### Entry-row anatomy (start row + picker trigger)

Both the start-of-chapter row and the **picker trigger** (the
always-visible button representing the current end pick) use the
same single-line shape:

```
[entry-num] [optional tag] [snippet — truncates with …]    [time]  [▾]
```

Fields, left-to-right:

- **Number** — `entry <N>` in muted monospace.
- **Optional tag** — small chip-style label when applicable
  (`Chapter <N> ended here` on the start row; `latest` on the
  picker trigger when the latest entry is selected).
- **Snippet** — first ~80 chars of `story_entries.content`,
  italicized. Single line; trailing ellipsis when truncated.
- **Time** — right-aligned. Formatted via the active calendar
  formatter (same formatter the reader's time chip uses).
- **Chevron** — picker trigger only. Rotates 180° when the panel
  is open.

Both rows render with the same border + padding so the start row
and picker trigger read as visually paired cards (start above,
end below).

### End-entry picker — dropdown panel

Default selection: the latest entry in the open region.

Clicking the picker trigger opens a dropdown panel **in-flow**
below it (the modal grows vertically; panel is scrollable when
more entries exist than fit in ~320px). Entries are listed
newest-first, back to the start of the open region.

Each dropdown item is a **two-line layout** (richer preview than
the single-line trigger):

```
entry-num [optional tag]                                [time]
"snippet wrapping to two lines via line-clamp; longer than the
trigger's single-line truncation; …"
```

- **Head row** — entry-num, optional tag, time right-aligned.
- **Snippet row** — same first ~80 chars of entry content,
  rendered with `line-clamp: 2` so up to two visual lines show
  before truncation. Gives the user a real read of each option,
  not a single-line tease.

The currently-selected row carries a subtle background tint (matches
the established selected-row styling elsewhere in the app); no
explicit `✓` glyph is needed because the picker trigger directly
above the panel already shows the current selection in full — the
dropdown is for _changing_ the selection, not re-confirming it.

Picking an entry:

1. Updates the trigger's snippet / number / tag / time.
2. Updates the modal's `tokens in range` line (live count for
   the new range).
3. Collapses the panel.

Why an explicit picker (vs a `close at latest` button): manual
chapter close is exactly the place users want to choose a natural
ending point (per
[data-model → Chapters / memory system](../../../data-model.md#chapters--memory-system):
"User can also manually trigger chapter-create at any time,
choosing the ending entry explicitly"). Latest-by-default covers
the common case; the picker covers the rest, and the
snippet + time are what make picking meaningful instead of
guesswork on bare numbers.

### Snippet origin

Snippet is the **first ~80 chars of `story_entries.content`** in
all surfaces (start row, picker trigger, dropdown items). One rule
across the modal — no end-of-entry / mid-entry variants. Same rule
also applies to the
[rollback-confirm modal's affected-entries display](../reader-composer/rollback-confirm/rollback-confirm.md).
The reader has the full text if a user wants more context; the
modals are scanning surfaces, not reading surfaces.

### Why a single shared modal

Both surfaces (this screen + reader popover) want the same close
flow. A shared modal:

- Keeps the start/end picker UX uniform regardless of trigger.
- Avoids drifting wording between two confirmation surfaces.
- Mirrors the
  [save-sessions navigate-away guard](../../patterns/save-sessions.md#navigate-away-guard--global-intercept)
  precedent — same modal, same copy across surfaces.

## Empty state

When the story has no closed chapters yet (entries 1..N all in the
open region), only the in-progress card renders. Header reads
`Chapters · 0 closed + 1 in progress`. The card itself works
normally — `Close chapter…` opens the modal with `Start: entry 1`
fixed.

## Top-bar

Standard in-story chrome per
[principles → Top-bar design rule](../../principles.md#top-bar-design-rule).
Breadcrumb: `<story-title> / Chapters`. Reader-only chrome (chapter
chip ▾, time chip, branch chip) is absent — Chapter Timeline is
already the chapter management surface, so the chapter chip in
particular would be redundant.

## Mobile expression

Single-pane card list — no master-detail collapse applies per
[`mobile/collapse.md → Single-pane surfaces`](../../foundations/mobile/collapse.md#single-pane-surfaces--no-collapse).
Phone reflows naturally: card padding compresses, per-card action
row wraps, chapter-close modal stays Modal at every tier with the
end-entry picker in-flow inside it.

- **Top-bar shape on phone** per
  [`mobile/navigation.md → Phone`](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#phone--640-px):
  slim single-row `[←] [<title> / Chapters] [pill] [⛭] [⚲]`.
  Reader-only chips (chapter, time, branch) absent — chapter-timeline
  is itself the chapter management surface, so the chapter chip
  would be redundant per the existing top-bar note.
- **Card list** stacks vertically as on desktop. Card padding
  compresses on phone (~12 px side-padding instead of desktop's
  20 px); collapsed-card metadata line
  (`<time range> · <token count> · <theme>`) wraps when content
  exceeds the line.
- **Per-card action row** collapses on phone to one primary button
  plus a `⋯` overflow trigger. `[Jump to chapter →]` keeps its full
  label as the primary affordance (navigation, non-destructive,
  most-used). `Regenerate summary` and `Delete…` tuck behind the
  `⋯` chip, which opens a Sheet (short) on phone per
  [`mobile/layout.md → Surface bindings`](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#surface-bindings--existing-app-surfaces).
  Same pattern as the
  [World detail-head's `⋯` overflow menu](../world/world.md#detail-head-structure);
  both destructive actions retain their existing confirmation flows
  inside the Sheet. Desktop and tablet keep all three buttons
  inline (the row fits naturally).
- **In-card save bar** appears at the card's bottom edge when
  dirty per
  [`patterns/save-sessions.md`](../../patterns/save-sessions.md).
  Hides while the keyboard is open per
  [`mobile/touch.md → Save bar on phone`](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#save-bar-on-phone),
  reappears on field blur. Navigate-away guard stays active.
- **In-progress chapter card** (specialized last card; no DB row
  yet). `[Close chapter…]` button full-width on phone for
  tap-target clarity. Token-progress bar reflows naturally.
- **Chapter-close modal** stays Modal at every tier per
  [`mobile/layout.md → Surface bindings`](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#surface-bindings--existing-app-surfaces).
  Modal width caps at viewport-minus-padding on phone per the modal
  contract. End-entry picker dropdown opens **in-flow** within the
  modal — the modal grows vertically, scrolls if the picker would
  push content past viewport height. No Modal-over-Sheet stacking
  introduced; the surface stack stays flat per
  [`mobile/layout.md → Stacking`](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#stacking).
- **Entry-row anatomy** (start row, picker trigger, dropdown
  items) unchanged on phone. Single-line `text-overflow: ellipsis`
  handles narrow widths; time chip right-aligned.
- **Empty state** (`Chapters · 0 closed + 1 in progress`) renders
  identically; only the in-progress card surfaces.
- **Stack-aware Return** binds chrome `←`, Android `BackHandler`,
  iOS swipe-back to existing pop-one-level semantics per
  [`mobile/navigation.md → Stack-aware Return`](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#stack-aware-return-on-mobile).
  Dirty card guard fires when navigating away with an expanded
  card unsaved.

## Screen-specific open questions

- **Re-run lore-mgmt for a closed chapter.** The Regenerate summary
  action only re-runs the metadata layer. Re-running lore-mgmt
  (Phase 3 of the chapter-close pipeline — lore creation, identity
  compaction, awareness pin tuning, happenings consolidation) would
  overwrite consolidated state; that's destructive and gated.
  Likely answer: "available, but only via an explicit consent-modal
  heavy enough that users don't fire it casually." See
  [`docs/memory/chapter-close.md`](../../../memory/chapter-close.md)
  for the phase contract.
- **Bulk chapter operations.** Multi-select to delete or
  re-generate-summary multiple chapters at once. Defer; matches
  the
  [bulk operations on entities](../../../parked.md#bulk-operations-on-entities)
  followup which sets the precedent.
- **Chapter merging / splitting.** "Merge chapter 3 into chapter
  4" or "split chapter 5 at entry N" — both are user-visible
  structural ops the data model could support but the UX hasn't
  been thought through. Defer until a real demand surfaces.
- **In-progress card while generation is active.** During the
  reader's pipeline phases (reasoning / generating / classifying /
  chapter-close), the `Close chapter…` button on this screen
  should disable. Same rule as
  [branch-navigator → during generation](../reader-composer/branch-navigator/branch-navigator.md#during-generation--switch--delete--create-blocked).
  Visual treatment chosen at integration time against the shipped
  [`foundations`](../../foundations/README.md).
- **Animation when the in-progress card transitions to closed.**
  After successful chapter close, the in-progress card morphs
  into a new closed card at the bottom of the timeline, plus a
  fresh in-progress card appears below it. Smooth transition vs
  hard re-render — chosen at integration time against the shipped
  [`foundations`](../../foundations/README.md).
