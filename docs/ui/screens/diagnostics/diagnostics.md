# Diagnostics Hub

Power-user / dev surface for inspecting what the AI pipeline did.
Tabbed page hosting the family of observability surfaces designed
around the contracts in
[`docs/observability.md`](../../../observability.md).

Gated by `app_settings.diagnostics.enabled` (master toggle). When
off, the hub entry is absent from the
[Actions menu](../../principles.md#top-bar-design-rule) — the
toggle itself is the discovery point.

Surface inventory plus per-tab detail for Tabs 2, 3, 4, and 5. The
doc names the structural pieces (top-bar, tab strip, story-anchor
selector, cross-tab nav, empty states, mobile expression) plus the
full body spec for each new tab below. Tab 1 (Memory probe)
references the existing [`memory-probe.md`](../memory-probe/memory-probe.md).

## Top-bar

App-level chrome `[←] [Diagnostics] [⚲]`. No status pill, no
chapter chip, no story chrome — even when a tab body pivots into
per-story content. Tab body owns its own story context.

Hub entry point lives in the **Actions (⚲) menu** as
`Open Diagnostics Hub`, visible only when the master toggle is on.

## Story selector

Three of the five tabs are story-anchored. The hub renders a
**story selector strip** below the top-bar:

```
Story  [The Tower of Aria ▾]   Branch  [main ▾]
```

Single source of truth for "which story are we inspecting"; the
three story-anchored tabs subscribe to it. App-global tabs ignore
the selector.

When the user opens the hub from an in-story context, the
selector pre-fills with the current story + branch. When opened
from out-of-story chrome (App Settings, Story List), the selector
prompts a pick before the story-anchored tabs render content
(story-anchored tabs show an inline "Pick a story" empty state
until a selection is made).

Detail (selector mobile expression, switch confirmation when
unsaved diagnostic UI state exists, etc.) for the per-tab detail
passes.

## Tab strip

Five tabs, in order:

| #   | Tab                | Anchor                | Source                       | Status                                                         |
| --- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Memory probe       | Story                 | `probe_captures` (persisted) | Existing — see [memory probe](../memory-probe/memory-probe.md) |
| 2   | Per-turn inspector | Story + turn          | `turnCaptures` (in-memory)   | New — see [Tab 2](#tab-2--per-turn-inspector) below            |
| 3   | Call log           | App-global            | `httpCalls` (in-memory)      | New — see [Tab 3](#tab-3--call-log) below                      |
| 4   | Logs               | App-global            | `logEntries` (in-memory)     | New — see [Tab 4](#tab-4--logs) below                          |
| 5   | Delta log          | Story (branch-scoped) | `deltas` (persisted)         | New — see [Tab 5](#tab-5--delta-log) below                     |

Tab strip renders via the
[Tabs primitive](../../patterns/tabs.md); optional per-tab count
badges render to the right of each label. Per-tab rules:

- Tab 2 (Per-turn inspector): story-scoped count (render-time filter
  by `branchId`), max-severity color over the outcome ladder
  (`failed` → danger, else `aborted` → warn, else neutral).
- Tab 3 (Call log): unfiltered buffer count, max severity color
  (5xx/transport-failed → danger, 4xx → warn, else neutral).
- Tab 4 (Logs): unfiltered buffer count, max severity color
  (error → danger, warn → warn, debug-only → neutral).
- Tab 5 (Delta log): scope-respecting count (branch-toggle aware),
  neutral color (no severity dimension on `deltas`).

### Tab 1 — Memory probe

Existing tab content per
[`memory-probe.md`](../memory-probe/memory-probe.md). The hub doc
references rather than relocates the existing screen — keeps the
memory-probe design integrity intact. Tab anchored to the story
selector.

### Tab 2 — Per-turn inspector

Story + turn-anchored. Sources `turnCaptures` slice. Two-pane shape:
list of recent turns on the left, four-section detail pane on the
right. List pane subscribes to the story selector (renders only
turns whose `branchId` matches a branch of the selected story —
render-time filter against the global `turnCaptures` buffer per
[Screen-specific open questions → Story selector switch](#screen-specific-open-questions)).

#### Two-pane shape (Per-turn inspector)

```

List pane width: ~320–360px on desktop/tablet. Detail pane fills the
remainder. Phone collapses list-first; see [Phone tier (Per-turn
inspector)](#phone-tier-per-turn-inspector).

#### List-pane row shape (Per-turn inspector)

Five columns: outcome dot, time, duration, one-line summary,
actionId.

```
[●completed] 14:02:18  8.4s   → entry #47                tr_a3kf
[●failed]    14:01:34  2.1s   classifier timeout         tr_92mp
[●aborted]   13:58:02  1.8s   aborted by user            tr_xkl0
[○in-flight] 14:02:38  ——     in flight…                 tr_b8nz
```

Visual treatment:

- **Outcome dot** — 8px circle, color by outcome.
  - `completed` → success-tint
  - `aborted` → warn-tint
  - `failed` → danger-tint
  - in-flight (`endedAt` undefined) → neutral pulsing dot, same
    1.5s ease-in-out animation as the Tab 3 status pulse.
- **Time** — `HH:MM:SS`, monospace.
- **Duration** — `8.4s` or `——` for in-flight. Mirrors Tab 3's
  convention.
- **Summary** — content depends on state:
  - `failed` / `aborted`: `outcomeReason`, truncated with ellipsis.
  - `completed`: `→ entry #<index>` for `targetEntryId`. Visual
    only in v1 (no tap-out wiring); the styling is consistent with
    a future reader-out jump if that affordance lands later.
  - in-flight: `in flight…` italic muted.
- **ActionId** — short monospace at the right edge, faint tone.
  Selection target is the whole row, not the actionId.

Tap = select row. Selected row gets a tint background + left-edge
emphasis bar (mirrors the inline-state-emphasis approach of
[entity row states](../../patterns/entity.md)).

#### List-pane filter (Per-turn inspector)

Single chip cluster above the scrollable list. Three
[Chip primitives](../../patterns/chips.md) — `completed` /
`aborted` / `failed` — severity-color-coded (success / warn /
danger respectively). All three default-selected; user toggles
during debug sessions to narrow.

**In-flight turns ignore the outcome filter.** Turns whose
`outcome` is still undefined have no bucket to match against; they
remain visible regardless of chip selection. They join the
appropriate bucket on resolve (live-state predicate evaluation,
same rule as Tab 3's State filter).

**No min-selection enforcement.** Zero selected = empty visible
set → `filters-hide-all` empty state fires.

Free-text search on actionId / outcomeReason and time-range
presets parked-until-signal — buffer caps at ~100 turns,
reverse-chrono ordering already gives recency; the realistic
debug workflow ("show me the failed turns") is served by the
outcome chips alone.

#### Detail-pane composition (Per-turn inspector)

**Four flat sections**, fixed order, no section-level accordion:

1. **Timeline** — gantt.
2. **Classifier raw output** — JSONBlock, collapsed by default.
3. **Calls** — cross-cut HTTP calls for this turn.
4. **Logs** — cross-cut log entries for this turn.

Sections render as plain heading rows in section-uppercase tone;
the only accordion inside the pane is the row-level accordion
within Calls / Logs sections (`type="single"`, inherited from Tab
3 / Tab 4). Section-level collapse is omitted because each section
has natural bounding: gantt is bounded (~80–120px for 5–8 phases),
the [Classifier JSONBlock](#classifier-raw-output-per-turn-inspector)
self-collapses, Calls and Logs sections virtualize internally per
[`patterns/lists.md`](../../patterns/lists.md).

#### Detail-pane context header (Per-turn inspector)

A thin header strip at the top of the detail pane shows the
selected turn's identity always:

```
Turn tr_92mp  · [failed] · 14:01:34 · 2.1s
```

Three fields: actionId (monospace), outcome badge (severity-coded
[Tag](../../patterns/chips.md#tag--pill-labeled-content)), and
`startedAt · duration` in muted tone. The strip is **load-bearing
when the selected row is hidden by the outcome chip filter** —
desktop without this strip would leave the user with detail
content but no list-pane anchor. When the row is visible, the strip
is mildly redundant but harmless.

Hidden on `hub-no-selection` (no turn picked) and
`hub-aged-out` (deep-link arrival on evicted turn) modes — the
empty-state copy carries the actionId in those cases.

#### Phase timeline gantt (Per-turn inspector)

Gantt-style horizontal bars positioned by phase events:

```
0ms                  1.1s                       2.1s (failed)
pre         ▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░    88ms
retrieval   ░▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   462ms
narrative   ░░░░░▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   798ms
classifier  ░░░░░░░░░░░░▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   752ms ✗
```

- **One bar per phase enter/exit pair**, derived from
  `phaseEvents`. Multiple enter/exit pairs for the same phase
  (e.g., retried `retrieval`) render as multiple bars on the same
  row.
- **Time axis fits the container.** Container width =
  `endedAt − startedAt` for finalized turns; for in-flight turns
  the axis spans `[startedAt, now]` recomputed every ~200ms (coarse
  tick to avoid sub-pixel jitter).
- **Active phase = open-ended bar** with a pulsing leading edge
  (reuses the Tab 3 pulse animation). Bar extends to `now`.
- **Aborted-mid-phase** = unmatched enter renders as a bar from
  the enter's `at` truncated at the turn's `endedAt`. No special
  "incomplete" indicator chrome; the truncated bar against the
  exited-phase peers reads as "this didn't finish."
- **Failed phase** (the phase during which the turn went to
  `failed` outcome) styled with danger tone.
- **Per-bar duration label** on the right edge: `462ms` / `1.8s`.
- **Minimum bar width**: bars whose proportional width would be
  < 4px clamp to 4px so sub-50ms phases stay visible. The
  duration label is the source of truth for actual timing.

**Empty `phaseEvents`** (orchestrator threw before any phase
enter): section renders the muted line `No phase events recorded.`

#### Classifier raw output (Per-turn inspector)

The classifier's pre-action-layer-validation structured output
(`classifierOutputRaw: unknown`). Renders as a [JSONBlock](../../patterns/data.md#json-content-block--inline-use)
in compact collapsed-by-default form:

```
{…} (3 keys: state_changes, lore_proposals, threads_touched)        [Expand JSON]
```

Expanding reveals the full pretty-printed JSON tree with a copy
icon-action. Reuses the JSONBlock contract verbatim — no
classifier-specific chrome.

**Empty / not-yet-recorded states:**

- `classifierOutputRaw === undefined`: section shows muted line
  `Waiting for classifier output…` (in-flight) or
  `No classifier output recorded.` (turn ended before classifier
  ran).
- Once populated, the field is final — the in-flight → resolved
  transition replaces the waiting line with the JSONBlock; expand
  state on the block is independent.

#### Cross-cut Calls / Logs sections (Per-turn inspector)

Embedded HTTP call + log entry rows filtered by `actionId == turn.actionId`.

**Row shapes reuse Tabs 3 + 4 verbatim with two modifications:**

- **No actionId chip column.** Every row in the section has the
  same actionId (the selected turn's); the chip would be visual
  noise.
- **`↗` icon-action at the row's right edge** replaces the
  actionId chip slot. Tap = navigate to source tab focused on this
  row via `actionId=X, focusEntryId=Y_callId|Y_logId` (existing
  cross-tab nav substrate). On phone: `↗ Open in Call log →` /
  `↗ Open in Logs →` appears in the Sheet header instead.

**Row-level accordion behavior unchanged from Tab 3 / Tab 4** —
`type="single"` per section (opening a row collapses the previous
in that section). Calls and Logs sections have independent
single-open scopes.

**Section headers carry counts**: `Calls (3)` / `Logs (4)` based
on the live filter against the cross-cut buffers.

**No local filter chrome inside the sections.** Turn-scoped volume
is small (~5–20 calls / ~10–50 logs); filtering needs route to the
source tab via the `↗` affordance. Re-implementing Toolbar chrome
locally would be half-fidelity duplication.

**Empty sections** render muted lines:

- `No HTTP calls captured for this turn.`
- `No log entries captured for this turn.`

Live append during in-flight turns: new rows insert at the top
(reverse-chrono); **scroll position anchored, not yanked** — if
the user is reading row #5, a new row #0 doesn't auto-scroll them
to top. Matches standard log-tailing behavior; cross-platform
anchoring builds on the project's virtualization stack
(`@tanstack/react-virtual` on web, `FlatList` on native) per
[`patterns/lists.md`](../../patterns/lists.md). Scroll-anchoring-
on-prepend is an open implementation question shared with the
reader-narrative surface; resolution lives at the lists pattern,
not duplicated per consumer.

#### Buffer-truth indication on cross-cut sections (Per-turn inspector)

`turnCaptures` (~100 cap) and `httpCalls` / `logEntries` (their own
caps) evict independently. A live turn capture may outlive its
cross-cut data — the section count then reflects "what's currently
in the buffer," not "what this turn actually emitted."

**Detection**: when `turn.startedAt < buffer[i].at` for the
buffer's own oldest entry, the cross-cut might be partial.

**Visual**: muted italic line below the section header:

```
Calls (3)
(some may have aged out — turn predates the call buffer's oldest entry)
─────────────────────────────
▾ 14:01:34  POST  api…  200  0.34s    ↗
…
```

Independent per section (Calls and Logs may age out at different
rates). Stays muted to avoid alarming the user — it's a truthful
caveat, not a warning.

#### In-flight UX (Per-turn inspector)

The selected turn may be in-flight (`endedAt` undefined). Per
sub-section behavior:

- **Timeline gantt** — open-ended bar on the active phase with
  pulsing leading edge; time axis spans `[startedAt, now]`
  re-fitted on render.
- **Classifier raw output** — `Waiting for classifier output…`
  muted line when `classifierOutputRaw` undefined; populates
  inline when the field arrives.
- **Calls / Logs sections** — rows append live; scroll-anchored
  per section above.
- **List-pane row** — neutral pulsing dot; on resolve, ~200ms
  crossfade to the outcome-colored dot. ULID identity preserved
  across the transition (mirrors the Tab 3 row-identity contract).

The inspector is read-only in v1; no edit / force-cancel
affordances. Future cancel-turn capability parked-until-signal
(see
[`parked.md → Diagnostics Per-turn inspector — force-cancel-turn affordance`](../../../parked.md#diagnostics-per-turn-inspector--force-cancel-turn-affordance)).

#### Selection mechanic (Per-turn inspector)

Tap any list-pane row to select. Detail pane re-renders for the
new turn. Selection state:

- **Persists across hub close/reopen** while master is on (same
  lifecycle as Tab 3 / Tab 4 / Tab 5 filter state).
- **Wipes on master toggle off** — the in-memory `turnCaptures`
  buffer clears alongside selection state.
- **Aged out mid-session** — when the selected turn evicts from
  the ~100-cap buffer (oldest finalized turn evicts first when a
  new turn pushes over), selection clears on next render. Detail
  pane falls back to the no-selection empty state with a transient
  muted note: `Selected turn aged out.` The note disappears on the
  next user interaction.

#### Cross-tab nav (Per-turn inspector)

**Inbound** from Tab 3 / Tab 4 / Tab 5 actionId chip → arrives at
Tab 2 with `actionId=X`. List pane scrolls to the matching turn
and selects it; detail pane renders. No Turn Tag chip needed
(selection itself is the explicit signal that the user navigated
in).

If the actionId is not in the `turnCaptures` buffer (aged out):
detail pane renders the **aged-out arrival** empty state with
escape buttons:

```
Turn tr_92mp aged out — its in-memory diagnostic capture is no
longer in the buffer.

Cross-cut HTTP calls and log entries for this actionId may still
exist in their own buffers. Open the source tab to inspect them.

[Open Call log for this turn]   [Open Logs for this turn]
```

The escape buttons set the same `actionId=X` deep-link param on
the destination tab. No degraded inline render (Tab 3 / Tab 4
already render the cross-cut filtered view natively when arrived
with the actionId).

**Outbound** from a cross-cut row's `↗` icon-action → navigates
to Tab 3 / Tab 4 with `actionId=X, focusEntryId=Y` per the
existing [Cross-tab nav substrate](#cross-tab-nav-substrate).
Selected turn in Tab 2 preserved so the back-affordance returns
intact.

#### Count badge (Per-turn inspector)

Story-scoped count: `turnCaptures` filtered render-time by
`branchId` matching a branch of the selected story. Hidden when no
story is selected (matches the "Pick a story" empty state).

Color by outcome max severity:

- Any `failed` → danger.
- Else any `aborted` → warn.
- Else (all `completed` / in-flight only) → neutral.

Decoupled from the outcome chip filter (matches the Tab 3 / Tab 4
ambient-signal rule).

#### Empty states (Per-turn inspector)

Five flavors:

- **No story selected** — hub-level rule; the
  [story selector strip](#story-selector) shows the "Pick a story"
  empty state.
- **Buffer empty for selected story**: "No turns captured for this
  story yet — trigger a turn to start."
- **Filters hide all** (outcome chip filter): "No turns match your
  filter · `[Clear filter]`."
- **No turn selected (detail pane)**: "Select a turn from the list
  to inspect." With transient `Selected turn aged out.` note when
  the previously-selected turn was just evicted.
- **Aged-out arrival** (deep link to evicted turn): per
  [Cross-tab nav](#cross-tab-nav-per-turn-inspector) above.

Inside detail-pane sections, empty cases are muted inline lines,
not full empty-states:

- `No phase events recorded.` (empty `phaseEvents`)
- `No classifier output recorded.` (finalized turn never reached
  classifier) / `Waiting for classifier output…` (in-flight)
- `No HTTP calls captured for this turn.`
- `No log entries captured for this turn.`

#### State persistence (Per-turn inspector)

Selected turn ID + outcome chip filter + per-section row expand
state persist while master is on; all wipe on master toggle off
alongside the in-memory `turnCaptures` buffer.

#### Phone tier (Per-turn inspector)

Two-pane collapses to list-first push:

- Tab strip falls back to Select per the Group C cardinality
  cascade (existing rule).
- List pane fills the viewport; tap a turn pushes the detail view.
- Top-bar in pushed state: `[←] Diagnostics · Turn tr_a3kf` —
  sub-title shows the selected turn's actionId so context is
  visible.
- Back arrow steps detail → list → tab strip.
- Outcome chip filter row remains visible at the top of the list
  view.
- Detail-pane sub-sections:
  - Gantt scrolls horizontally when needed.
  - Classifier JSONBlock pretty-prints with word-wrap (no
    horizontal scroll) since output isn't typically token-aligned.
  - Cross-cut Calls / Logs rows use Tab 3 / Tab 4 phone shape
    (two-line row → Raw JSON viewer Sheet). The `↗` icon-action
    moves to the Sheet header as `↗ Open in Calls →` /
    `↗ Open in Logs →`.

#### Implementation notes (Per-turn inspector)

- **Gantt rendering** is novel — no existing primitive. Cross-
  platform implementation: SVG or absolute-positioned `View`s with
  percentage widths. RN-side, `transform`-based positioning with
  Reanimated for the in-flight active-bar tick + pulse.
- **Tick rate for in-flight time axis**: ~200ms is sufficient
  (faster ticks cause sub-pixel jitter without visual benefit).
  Drives a single `setInterval` while any in-flight turn is
  selected; no per-bar timer.
- **Render-time branch filter**: list-pane consumes the global
  `turnCaptures` buffer with a memoized filter on the active
  story's branches. The filter is the source of truth; no separate
  per-story `turnCaptures` partition is needed (matches the
  approach resolved in [Screen-specific open questions](#screen-specific-open-questions)).
- **Cross-cut row identity**: ULID-keyed for both Calls and Logs
  cross-cuts (same contract as Tab 3 / Tab 4 row identity), so
  in-flight rows updating their state in place during the
  selection don't churn React keys.
- **Buffer-truth detection**: a cross-cut section is "potentially
  partial" when the buffer's `[0].at` (oldest entry) is newer than
  `turn.startedAt`. Compute on render; cheap.
- **Selection ID lifecycle**: stored in the diagnostics store
  alongside outcome filter + master toggle state. Cleared on
  master toggle off and on selected-turn eviction.

### Tab 3 — Call log

App-global. Sources `httpCalls` slice. Single-list view,
reverse-chronological by `startedAt`.

#### Row shape — desktop and tablet (Call log)

Six-column grid: chevron, time, method, URL, status slot,
duration, actionId chip.

```
[▸] 14:02:18  POST  api.anthropic.com/v1/messages              [○]      ——        tr_a3kf
[▾] 14:02:17  POST  api.anthropic.com/v1/messages              [200]    1.84s     tr_a3kf
[▸] 14:02:16  POST  api.anthropic.com/v1/messages              [503]    12.3s     tr_a3kf
[▸] 14:01:58  POST  api.anthropic.com/v1/messages              [ERR]    8.42s     tr_92mp
```

Visual treatment:

- **Chevron** — left edge, 24px column. Rotates -90° collapsed →
  0° expanded per [`patterns/accordion.md → Chevron direction`](../../patterns/accordion.md#chevron-direction).
- **Time** — `ui-monospace`, `--fg-muted`, formatted `HH:MM:SS`.
- **Method** — short label (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.),
  monospace, ~50px column.
- **URL** — host + path. `ui-monospace`, truncates with ellipsis
  at column width. Auth path segments unchanged (redaction
  applies to header values only, not URL).
- **Status slot** — focal state-aware visual. See
  [Row state-aware visual](#row-state-aware-visual-tab-3) below.
- **Duration** — `1.84s` or `——` for in-flight. Right-aligned.
- **ActionId chip** — same treatment as Tab 4: labeled box with
  `--info` tone when present, dashed-border placeholder when
  empty.

Whole row is the [accordion trigger](../../patterns/accordion.md);
ActionId chip is a distinct nested tap target.

#### Row state-aware visual (Tab 3)

The status slot adapts per `state`:

- **In-flight** — `[○]` pulsing dot, neutral tone. ~14-16px,
  1.5s ease-in-out opacity (0.4 → 1 → 0.4) + subtle scale
  (1 → 1.05 → 1). Replaces the chip slot during in-flight; same
  position, different visual. Duration column shows `——`.
- **Completed** — solid chip with specific status code (`200`,
  `404`, `503` — not the bucket label). Tone keyed to bucket:
  `2xx` success, `3xx` info, `4xx` warn, `5xx` danger.
- **Failed (transport)** — `[ERR]` chip, danger tone. No status
  code (fetch threw before response).

**Transition**: in-flight → completed/failed = ~200ms crossfade
in the status slot. Dot fades out, chip fades in. Duration
populates simultaneously. Row position stable (reverse-chrono by
`startedAt`); identity is ULID-keyed per the
[Row identity stability](#row-identity-stability-call-log)
contract below. No list re-sort, no React-key churn.

##### Row identity stability (Call log)

Per-row state (expand, hover) is keyed on the call's ULID, not
on its rendering state. Filter predicates evaluate against the
live row's current state (not a snapshot) — a completing
in-flight call doesn't pop in/out of a State-filtered view; it
just updates which predicate matches.

#### Row expansion — tablet+ (Call log)

Single-open accordion. Expanded body renders a
[`JSONBlock`](../../patterns/data.md#json-content-block--inline-use)
that adapts per state:

- **In-flight**: request section only (method, URL, headers with
  redaction, request body). Response section reads `Waiting for
response…` muted line.
- **Completed**: request section + `─── Response ───` divider +
  response section (status, response headers with redaction,
  duration, response body).
- **Failed**: request section + `─── Error ───` divider + error
  section (error message, error kind like `NetworkError` /
  `TimeoutError`, any partial response chunks if captured).

Expand state survives the in-flight → resolved transition per
the stable-identity contract: if the user expanded while
in-flight, response/error data appears inline on resolution
without collapsing.

##### Header redaction

Redacted headers per [`observability.md → Header redaction`](../../../observability.md#header-redaction)
render their literal mask value `'***'` in the JSONBlock. No
special chrome on the redacted line — `'***'` is the signal. No
inline disclaimer, no banner.

#### Row shape — phone (Call log)

Two-line shape, no chevron. Whole row tappable; tap opens the
[Raw JSON viewer Sheet](../../patterns/data.md#raw-json-viewer--shared-modal-pattern)
(bottom, tall ~95%). Sheet content adapts per state same as the
tablet+ inline body.

```
14:02:18  POST  [200]   1.84s   tr_a3kf
api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
─────────────────────────────────────────────
14:02:17  POST  [○]     ——      tr_a3kf
api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
```

Top line: time, method, status slot, duration, actionId chip.
Bottom line: URL (full, no truncate).

Sheet header for the opened entry: `HTTP · <method> · <URL host>
· <time>` (e.g., `HTTP · POST · api.anthropic.com · 14:02:17`).

#### Filters (Call log)

Four dimensions composing the [Toolbar pattern](../../patterns/toolbar.md):

- **URL/body** (free-text) — `Toolbar.Search` slot. Substring
  match against URL string + request body content.
- **State** (multi-select chips: `in-flight`, `completed`,
  `failed`) — fills `Toolbar.FilterChips`. Each chip uses the
  severity-coded [Chip primitive](../../patterns/chips.md):
  in-flight neutral, completed success, failed danger. Three
  fixed values → chips by the Tab 4 precedent.
- **Source** ([MultiSelect](../../patterns/multi-select.md)) —
  provider/embedder/etc. enum. Could grow (multiple providers +
  embedders ship). MultiSelect.
- **Status range** (MultiSelect) — five fixed buckets `1xx / 2xx /
3xx / 4xx / 5xx`. Five is at the chip boundary; chose
  MultiSelect to keep the chrome cluster manageable on phone.
  Inside the overlay, each row carries a small leading
  severity-color dot so the bucket-tone is visible when the
  overlay is open.

Desktop (≥ 1024px) renders as one horizontal row:

```
URL: [filter URL or body………]   State [in-flight][completed][failed]   [Source: 3 of 8 ▾]   [Status: 4 of 5 ▾]
```

Phone / narrow tablet (< 1024px) follows the
[Toolbar cross-tier overflow rule](../../patterns/toolbar.md#cross-tier-overflow-rule).

**No min-selection enforcement**: Source / State / Status filters
allow 0 selected. User toggling to clear-all-then-pick-one is a
normal mid-interaction state. Empty visible set → filters-hide-all
empty state fires naturally.

#### Cross-tab nav (Call log)

Outbound: actionId chip on a row → per-turn inspector for that
turn (when actionId present and turn capture is still in ring
buffer).

Inbound from per-turn inspector clicking a specific HTTP call:
`actionId=X, focusEntryId=Y_callId` arrival. Nudges per the
[Tab 4 nudge substrate](#nudge-rule):

- Multi-select chips and dropdowns (State, Source, Status) ADD
  the focus call's values to the selection if missing.
- URL/body free-text does NOT auto-clear. If it would hide the
  focus call, fall through to the empty-state with `[Clear URL]`
  button.

Auto-scroll + auto-expand the focused call. Turn Tag chip
appended to the filter row's secondary cluster.

Inbound broad (`actionId=X` only): apply filter, preserve other
filters, empty-state with clear-buttons if intersection is empty.

#### Count badge (Call log)

Unfiltered `httpCalls` buffer total, always rendered. Color by
max severity present:

- Any failed (transport) OR any completed 5xx → danger.
- Any completed 4xx → warn.
- Else (in-flight, completed 2xx/3xx only) → neutral.

Decoupled from filter state — same rule as Tab 4 with the
severity ladder mapped to HTTP outcome instead of log level.

#### Empty states (Call log)

Three flavors, mirroring Tab 4:

- **Buffer empty** (master on, no calls captured yet): "No HTTP
  calls captured yet — trigger a turn or wait for a background
  call."
- **Filters hide all, no actionId**: "No calls match your filters
  · `[Clear filters]`."
- **Filters hide all, actionId arrival**: "No calls match your
  filters for Turn `tr_a3kf` · `[Clear other filters]`
  `[Clear actionId]`."

#### State persistence (Call log)

Same as Tab 4: filter + expand state persist as long as master
is on; clear on master toggle-off.

#### Mobile expression (Call log)

Call log is app-global. On phone with Call log active, both
story selector and branch picker hide entirely (same rule as
Tab 4). Filter row follows the
[Toolbar cross-tier overflow rule](../../patterns/toolbar.md#cross-tier-overflow-rule).
Tab strip falls back to Select per the Group C cardinality
cascade.

#### Implementation notes (Call log)

- **Stable ULID-keyed identity** across the in-flight →
  completed/failed transition. Filter predicates evaluate live
  state per render, not snapshot.
- **Pulse animation**: web via CSS keyframes; native via
  Reanimated `withRepeat(withTiming(...))`. ~1.5s loop.
- **Crossfade transition**: simple opacity ease ~200ms on the
  status slot when state field updates.
- **Virtualization** per [`patterns/lists.md`](../../patterns/lists.md)
  for the call list; controlled `openItemId` ref for the
  single-open accordion state.
- **Header redaction** is sink-side per
  [`observability.md`](../../../observability.md#header-redaction);
  this surface just renders what it receives.

### Tab 4 — Logs

App-global. Sources `logEntries` slice. Single-list,
reverse-chronological by `emittedAt`.

#### Row shape — desktop and tablet

Six-column grid: chevron, time, level, kind, fields-preview,
actionId chip.

```
[▸] 14:02:18  warn  classifier.delta_clamped  { originalDelta: -1800, … }  tr_a3kf
[▾] 14:02:17  warn  provider.retry_succeeded  { attempt: 2, latencyMs: 1840 }  tr_a3kf
    └─ expanded JSON block (see below)
[▸] 14:02:16  error retrieval.knn_error       { reason: "vec0_index_corrupt", … }  tr_a3kf
```

Visual treatment:

- **Chevron** — left edge, 24px column. Rotates -90° collapsed →
  0° expanded per [`patterns/accordion.md → Chevron direction`](../../patterns/accordion.md#chevron-direction).
- **Time** — `ui-monospace`, `--fg-muted`, formatted `HH:MM:SS`.
- **Level** — uppercase short tag (`WARN`, `ERROR`, `DEBUG`), tone
  per severity. `warn` → `--warn`; `error` → `--danger`; `debug` →
  neutral.
- **Kind** — `ui-monospace`. Sub-namespace prefix (`classifier.`)
  renders muted; suffix (`delta_clamped`) renders at `--fg-primary`.
  Conveys the namespace/event split visually.
- **Fields preview** — `ui-monospace`, `--fg-muted`, truncates
  with ellipsis at column width.
- **ActionId chip** — labeled box, `--info` toned when present,
  `—` placeholder dashed-border when empty. Tap behavior: see
  [Cross-tab nav](#cross-tab-nav-logs).

Whole row is the [accordion trigger](../../patterns/accordion.md) —
tap anywhere on the row toggles expansion. ActionId chip is a
distinct tap target nested inside the row (per the
[SwitchRow tap-plumbing convention](../../patterns/forms.md#switchrow-pattern):
inner target takes its own tap, doesn't bubble to the row).

#### Row expansion — tablet+

Single-open accordion (`type="single"`). Opening a row collapses
any previously expanded row. Reasoning: log inspection is
per-entry; multi-open creates dense vertical noise on a list that
may carry hundreds of rows.

Expanded body renders a `JSONBlock` containing the full `fields`
JSON:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [▾] 14:02:17  warn  …                              │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                          [📋 Copy] │
│ {                                                  │
│   "attempt": 2,                                    │
│   "latencyMs": 1840,                               │
│   "status": 200,                                   │
│   "source": "provider:anthropic-main"              │
│ }                                                  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Pretty-printed JSON, monospace, full-width within the row. Copy
icon-action at top-right. Reuses the
[Raw JSON viewer body content shape](../../patterns/data.md#json-content-block--inline-use)
(JSONBlock) — the inline use is the same content as the Sheet body,
sans drawer chrome.

**Empty fields case**: row still expandable; body renders `{}`
plus a muted line "No fields recorded for this entry." No special
row treatment.

#### Row shape — phone

Two-line row, no chevron. Whole row tappable; tap opens the
[Raw JSON viewer Sheet](../../patterns/data.md#raw-json-viewer--shared-modal-pattern)
(bottom, tall ~95%).

```
14:02:18  warn                                       tr_a3kf
classifier.delta_clamped
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
14:02:17  warn                                       tr_a3kf
provider.retry_succeeded
```

Top line: time, level, actionId chip (right-aligned). Bottom line:
kind (full, no truncation). Fields preview is dropped on phone —
users tap to see the full payload in the Sheet, not a teaser in
the row.

Sheet header for the opened entry: `Log fields · <kind> · <time>`
(e.g., `Log fields · classifier.delta_clamped · 14:02:17`).
Disambiguates which entry the Sheet is for.

#### Filters — Toolbar composition

The filter row composes the [Toolbar pattern](../../patterns/toolbar.md).
Three filter dimensions slot in:

- **Kind** (free-text substring match against `kind`) — fills the
  `Toolbar.Search` slot. Primary input at `md` height.
- **Level** (multi-select chips: `warn`, `error`, `debug`) —
  fills `Toolbar.FilterChips`. Each chip uses the severity-coded
  [Chip primitive](../../patterns/chips.md) — warn-tone, danger-tone,
  neutral respectively. `debug` chip listed only when
  `debug_level_enabled` is on.
- **Subsystem** (multi-select against the
  [`LogSubsystem` union](../../../observability.md#kind-namespace)) —
  renders as a [MultiSelect](../../patterns/multi-select.md) trigger
  (`Subsystem: 4 of 8 ▾`) in the secondary chrome cluster. Replaces
  the chip-row treatment from the prior surface inventory: as the
  union grows, the trigger stays constant-width, the overlay
  scrolls.

Desktop (≥ 1024px) renders as one horizontal row:

```
Kind: [filter by kind………]   Level [warn][error][debug]   [Subsystem: 4 of 8 ▾]
```

Phone / narrow tablet (< 1024px) follows Toolbar's cross-tier
overflow rule: Kind on its own row at `md`, Level chips + Subsystem
trigger wrap below at `xs`.

#### Cross-tab nav (Logs)

Two arrival shapes coexist via the shared `actionId` deep-link
param:

| Route                                                                                         | Behavior                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `actionId=X, focusEntryId=Y` (specific log entry clicked from per-turn inspector)             | Apply actionId filter. Nudge other filters to make Y visible (see [Nudge rule](#nudge-rule)). Auto-scroll to Y; auto-expand the row.                       |
| `actionId=X` only (broad nav: per-turn inspector overall actionId, or Call log actionId chip) | Apply actionId filter. User's other filters preserved as-is. If intersection is empty: arrived-empty empty-state (see [Empty states](#empty-states-logs)). |

##### Nudge rule

When `focusEntryId` is provided and existing filters would hide
the entry, nudge filters minimally to make the entry visible.
Splits by filter type:

- **Multi-select chips and dropdowns (Level, Subsystem)**: ADD the
  focus entry's value to the selected set if missing. Always
  additive — never removes from the selection.
- **Free-text Kind input**: does NOT auto-clear. If Kind would
  hide the focus entry, fall through to the
  [Filters-hide-with-Kind empty-state](#empty-states-logs) — user
  decides whether to drop their typed value.

Nudge is silent. The Turn Tag chip's presence (see below) is the
explicit signal that filter state was modified by the route. Toast
on every nudge would create noise on repeated nav; the chip is
enough.

##### Turn Tag chip

A [Tag](../../patterns/chips.md#tag--pill-labeled-content), accent-
toned, appended to the secondary chrome cluster of the filter row:

```
… Level [warn][error][debug]   [Subsystem: 4 of 8 ▾]   [Turn: tr_a3kf ×]
```

Uses the user-facing term "Turn" — the schema's internal `actionId`
maps to the hub's "Story + turn" anchor in the tab table.

Tap × removes the actionId filter. Nudged-in filter values stay
(the user's filter state is theirs once they're in Logs). No
"undo the nav arrival" behavior — explicit toggling is the floor.

Tag chip position on phone-tier wrap-flow is positionally flexible
— accent tone provides the visual disambiguation, not spatial
pinning.

##### Outbound nav

Tap the actionId chip on a Log row → open per-turn inspector
focused on that turn (per the cross-tab nav substrate).

#### Count badge (Logs)

Two semantically distinct decisions:

- **Count source**: unfiltered total of the in-memory `logEntries`
  buffer. Always rendered, even when 0. Decouples the badge from
  filter state — the badge is a buffer-level indicator. User
  filtering narrowly sees the filtered list, but the badge tells
  them how many entries are in the buffer overall.
- **Color rule**: matches the chip color of the highest severity
  level present in the buffer. `error` > `warn` > `debug` (neutral).
  Empty buffer → neutral, count 0. Shares the severity-to-color
  palette with the Level filter chips.

When the buffer has any `error` entries the badge is danger-toned
even if the user is filtered to debug-only — informing them that a
high-severity entry exists but is currently hidden by filters.

#### Empty states (Logs)

Three flavors:

- **Buffer empty** (master on, no logs captured yet): "No log
  entries captured yet — trigger a turn or wait for a background
  event to populate the log."
- **Filters hide all, no actionId**: "No entries match your filters
  · `[Clear filters]`."
- **Filters hide all, actionId arrival**: "No entries match your
  filters for Turn `tr_a3kf` · `[Clear other filters]`
  `[Clear actionId]`."

The last two render below the filter row, replacing the log list
area. `Clear filters` resets Level / Subsystem / Kind to their
defaults; `Clear actionId` removes the Turn Tag chip; `Clear other
filters` preserves the Turn chip while resetting the others.

#### State persistence

Filter state + single-open expand state **persist as long as
master is on**. Closing the hub via back-arrow preserves state;
reopening finds it intact. State clears on master toggle-off
(consistent with the in-memory ring-buffer wipe semantics from
[`observability.md → Wipe semantics`](../../../observability.md#wipe-semantics)).

#### Mobile expression (Logs)

Logs is app-global. On phone with Logs active, both the story
selector and branch picker hide entirely — Logs doesn't care about
story selection, and showing them would be misleading chrome.
Saves ~32px of phone chrome.

Filter row follows the [Toolbar cross-tier overflow rule](../../patterns/toolbar.md#cross-tier-overflow-rule)
(Kind own row, Level chips + Subsystem trigger wrap below). Row
layout follows the [phone two-line shape](#row-shape--phone). Tab
strip renders via the [Tabs primitive's](../../patterns/tabs.md)
phone substitution to Select at narrow tiers.

#### Implementation notes (Logs)

Not design decisions, but worth surfacing for the eventual
scaffolder:

- **Log list needs virtualization** per [`patterns/lists.md`](../../patterns/lists.md)
  — buffer can grow to hundreds of entries during heavy inspection.
- **Single-open accordion state lives in a controlled `openItemId`
  ref on the tab body**, not per-AccordionItem state. Virtualized
  scroll unmounts off-screen rows; per-item state would lose
  expansion when the user scrolls out and back. Controlled state
  from above survives the unmount.
- **Cross-tab nav routing** uses the shared `actionId` deep-link
  param; `focusEntryId` is an additional optional parameter that
  drives the auto-focus + auto-expand arrival shape.

### Tab 5 — Delta log

Story-anchored. Branch-scoped by default (inherits the story
selector's branch), with a scope-override toggle to expand to
all branches in the story. Sources the canonical `deltas` table
(persisted by design — see
[`data-model.md → Entry mutability & rollback`](../../../data-model.md#entry-mutability--rollback)).

#### Row shape — unscoped DeltaLogRow variant

Reuses the [DeltaLogRow pattern](../../patterns/delta-log-row.md)
as-is. Same primitive World and Plot per-entity History tabs
use; Tab 5 is the **unscoped-across-rows** consumer
(every delta in the story, not one entity's lineage). The host
prefixes `targetDisplayName` with table type to disambiguate
across kinds:

- `Entity · Kael`
- `Thread · Iron Pact`
- `Happening · The Bridge Collapse`
- `Lore · The Iron Pact (religion)`
- `Translation · entry #47 (es)`

Per [`delta-log-row.md → Target line`](../../patterns/delta-log-row.md):
"the host can supply 'Entity · Kael' or 'Thread · Iron Pact'
prefixed strings." Tab 5 is the first consumer adopting this
variant.

Diff cache pending fallback is built into the pattern's
`summary: string` contract: cache miss → host produces a
keys-only summary (e.g., `Modified traits, drives`); cache
populate → host upgrades to rich prose (e.g.,
`Added "former soldier"; was ["brave", "loyal"]`). Tab 5 inherits
this without local additions.

#### Row tap behavior

Tab 5 rows have two distinct tap targets:

- **Row body** → opens the [Raw JSON viewer Sheet](../../patterns/data.md#raw-json-viewer--shared-modal-pattern)
  showing the `undo_payload` JSON. Sheet header:
  `Delta · <op> · <target> · <time>` (e.g.,
  `Delta · update · Entity · Kael · 2h ago`).
- **ActionId chip** → cross-tab nav to per-turn inspector when
  present AND turn capture is still in ring buffer. When the
  turn has aged out: chip is informational only — tap shows
  `this turn's diagnostic data has aged out — only its deltas
remain` as a muted tooltip (desktop) / inline toast (phone).

**No inline accordion expansion.** Tab 5 rows are already
3-line (op badge + target line + summary + meta). Stacking a
tall expanded body below would dominate the list; the Sheet
overlay is the right surface for the full `undo_payload`. The
previously-deferred [DeltaLogRow inline-diff-expansion](../../patterns/delta-log-row.md#what-this-design-defers)
followup stays deferred.

**Divergence from World/Plot tap behavior.** World/Plot wire
DeltaLogRow's `onPress` to "open in target detail pane" (exits
to the entity/lore/thread/happening home surface). Tab 5 wires
it to "open Raw JSON viewer Sheet" (stays in hub for
inspection). Per the [pattern doc's host-wired contract](../../patterns/delta-log-row.md#click-behavior),
divergence is allowed; the implementer wires `onPress` to open
the Sheet here. Cross-hub-out "navigate to target detail pane"
is parked-until-signal (see
[`parked.md → Diagnostics Delta log — cross-hub-out detail-pane navigation`](../../../parked.md#diagnostics-delta-log--cross-hub-out-detail-pane-navigation)).

#### Filters (Delta log)

Six dimensions composing the [Toolbar pattern](../../patterns/toolbar.md):

```
Filter: [filter by name or field path…]   [Source: 3 of 8 ▾]   [Target: 2 of 6 ▾]   [This branch | All branches]   [Time: Last 1h ▾]
```

- **Filter** (free-text) — `Toolbar.Search` slot. Substring
  match against target display names and field paths.
- **Source** ([MultiSelect](../../patterns/multi-select.md)) —
  `classifier / lore_mgmt / user_edit / chapter_close / ...`
  (deltas source enum).
- **Target table** MultiSelect — `entities / lore / happenings /
threads / translations / ...` (deltas target_table enum).
- **Branch segment** — 2-segment Select `[This branch | All
branches]`. Inherits the story-selector's current branch; the
  segment is a _scope override_, not a branch picker. The story
  selector continues to pick the working branch.
- **Time range** Select — `Toolbar.Sort` slot. Single-select
  dropdown with presets `All time / Last 5m / Last 15m / Last 1h
/ Last 6h / Last 24h`. Default `All time`.

##### Branch segment — semantic two-option pick

`[This branch | All branches]` is a semantic two-option pick (not
a boolean on/off), per the [forms.md SwitchRow precedent](../../patterns/forms.md#switchrow-pattern):
segment is valid for semantic two-option picks, off-limits for
`[off | on]` booleans. The labels make the scope explicit at a
glance; chip-toggle alternative (`[All branches]` alone, off =
implicit current) was rejected for off-state ambiguity.

##### Time range — wall-clock anchor

Presets anchor to wall-clock-now, not to story activity.
"Last 1h" = deltas with `created_at` between `(now - 1h)` and
`now`. Reasoning: users read "last hour" with literal recency
semantics; anchoring to story activity creates surprise when
reopening across days. A user wanting "the last hour of activity
in this story" picks `All time`.

Absolute date-range picker (`From [date] To [date]`) parked —
power-user shape, low v1 demand.

##### No min-selection enforcement

Source / Target table filters allow 0 selected. Empty visible
set → filters-hide-all empty state fires naturally.

#### Cross-tab nav (Delta log)

Outbound: actionId chip → per-turn inspector when actionId is
present on the delta AND the corresponding turn capture is still
in ring buffer. Aged-out fallback: tooltip / toast as documented
in [Row tap behavior](#row-tap-behavior).

Inbound from per-turn inspector clicking a specific delta:
`actionId=X, focusDeltaId=Y` arrival. Nudges per the Tab 4
substrate, with one Tab 5-specific addition:

- **Branch toggle nudge**: if the focus delta is on a different
  branch than the current scope, the Branch segment expands to
  `[All branches]` silently. Additive scope-expansion mirrors
  the Level / Subsystem additive nudge.
- Multi-select chips and dropdowns (Source, Target) ADD the
  focus delta's values if missing.
- Free-text Filter does NOT auto-clear; fall through to
  empty-state if conflict.
- Time range nudges to `All time` if the focus delta's
  `created_at` falls outside the current window.

**Auto-emphasis without accordion**: Tab 5 has no inline expand.
Focus-row emphasis is scroll-into-view + a transient ~1.5s
ease-out background tint that fades to normal. After the fade,
the row is visually indistinct from neighbors. The Turn Tag chip

- tint flash + scroll-into-view together communicate the
  arrival.

Inbound broad (`actionId=X` only): apply filter, preserve other
filters, empty-state with clear-buttons if intersection is
empty.

#### Count badge (Delta log)

Unfiltered count of deltas in the current scope (respects the
Branch segment's setting — current branch only, or all branches
in the story). Other within-scope filters (Source, Target, Time,
Filter, actionId) do not affect the badge.

**No severity dimension**: color stays neutral. The
[`deltas` source / op enums](../../../data-model.md#diagram)
don't carry a severity ordering equivalent to log-level or HTTP
status. Confirms the Tab 4 close-out's per-tab note.

#### Empty states (Delta log)

Three flavors:

- **Scope empty** (no deltas in branch): "No deltas in this
  scope yet — turns produce deltas after the classifier runs."
- **Filters hide all, no actionId**: "No deltas match your
  filters · `[Clear filters]`."
- **Filters hide all, actionId arrival**: "No deltas match your
  filters for Turn `tr_a3kf` · `[Clear other filters]`
  `[Clear actionId]`."

#### State persistence (Delta log)

Same as Tabs 3 and 4: filter + branch-toggle + time-range state
persist as long as master is on; clear on master toggle-off.

#### Mobile expression (Delta log)

Delta log is story-anchored — the story selector + branch picker
remain visible on phone (consistent with the hub-level mobile
expression rule). Phone-tier row inherits DeltaLogRow's natural
3-line layout (op badge + target line / summary / meta line);
no separate phone-tier shape needed.

Filter row follows the [Toolbar cross-tier overflow rule](../../patterns/toolbar.md#cross-tier-overflow-rule):
Filter on own row at `md`, secondary cluster (Source MS + Target
MS + Branch segment + Time Select) wraps below at `xs`, possibly
to 2 visual lines on phone. With actionId arrival, the Turn Tag
chip joins the secondary cluster (3 visual lines worst-case).
The tightest filter chrome in the hub, but acceptable for
Tab 5's inspection focus.

#### Cost notes

Unlike the other tabs, Tab 5 queries a persisted, growing table.
Active stories accumulate dozens of deltas per turn. Query
needs `LIMIT` + virtualization per
[`patterns/lists.md`](../../patterns/lists.md). Tab 5 inherits
the [delta diff cache](../../../architecture.md#delta-history-diff-resolution)
prerequisite for `(old → new)` rendering; doesn't add new
dependencies.

#### Implementation notes (Delta log)

- **Single-tap-target on row body**: `Pressable` row wires
  `onPress` to open the Raw JSON viewer Sheet with the
  delta's `undo_payload`. ActionId chip is a nested
  `Pressable` with `stopPropagation` so its tap doesn't bubble
  to the row body.
- **Auto-emphasis tint** on focus-row arrival: ~1.5s ease-out
  background tint via CSS keyframe (web) / Reanimated
  `withTiming` (native). One-shot animation triggered by the
  arrival nav.
- **Virtualization** per [`patterns/lists.md`](../../patterns/lists.md).
  Row data fetched via paged query against the `deltas` table
  scoped to the branch toggle + time range; in-scope rows
  rendered via virtualized list. Filter predicates apply on the
  rendered rows.
- **Branch toggle nudge** on cross-tab arrival: implementation
  hooks the same arrival-handling code path that nudges
  multi-select chips, just operating on the branch-segment
  state.

## Cross-tab nav substrate

Tabs share an `actionId` deep-link parameter. A tab transition
that includes an actionId sets this parameter and auto-focuses
the appropriate row in the destination tab. An optional
`focusEntryId` parameter narrows the arrival to a specific row
(driving auto-scroll + auto-expand behavior at the destination —
see [Tab 4 → Cross-tab nav](#cross-tab-nav-logs) for the worked
example).

Per-tab filter and view state (active filter chips, expand state,
selected row) **persist as long as master is on** — closing the
hub via back-arrow preserves state, reopening finds it intact.
State clears on master toggle-off, consistent with the in-memory
ring-buffer wipe semantics from
[`observability.md → Wipe semantics`](../../../observability.md#wipe-semantics).

## Empty states

- **Master OFF + deep link to hub** — "Diagnostics is off — turn
  on the master toggle to enable capture" with a link to App
  Settings · Diagnostics. The hub entry in the Actions menu is
  hidden when master is off, so this state is reached only via
  direct route navigation.
- **Master ON + buffers empty** — per-tab copy ("No turns
  captured yet — trigger a turn to start" / "No calls yet" / "No
  log entries yet" / "No delta rows yet"). Memory probe's empty
  state stays as documented in its own screen doc.

## Mobile expression

Tab strip via the [Tabs primitive](../../patterns/tabs.md) —
horizontal strip on tablet+, falls back to Select at phone tier
per the existing
[Group C cardinality cascade](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md).

Each tab body inherits whatever list-pane / two-pane pattern fits
its shape: per-turn inspector uses two-pane (collapses to
list-first on phone per the standard rule); Call log, Logs, and
Delta log are single-list with row expansion. Memory probe's
existing mobile design carries over unchanged.

Story selector strip on phone collapses to a single-row affordance
showing only the active story name with a tap-to-switch picker;
branch picker moves to the per-tab filter row when a
story-anchored tab is active. When an **app-global** tab is active
(Logs, Call log) both story selector and branch picker hide
entirely — saves ~32px of phone chrome; the app-global tabs don't
care about story selection and showing them would be misleading.

## Screen-specific open questions

- **Story selector switch when buffers contain other-story data.**
  Switching stories doesn't wipe the per-story `turnCaptures` —
  the buffer is keyed by `actionId`, not story. Should
  story-anchored tabs hide entries whose `branchId` doesn't match
  the current story selection (filter at render-time), or should
  the buffer wipe on story switch? Lean: filter at render-time;
  buffer survives story switches so the user can flip back. Detail
  for the per-tab passes.
- **Cross-window aggregation on Electron** — each window has its
  own diagnostics store. If a user opens the hub in window A
  while turns run in window B, hub A's buffers are empty. Parked
  as
  [Cross-window aggregator](../../../parked.md#observability--cross-window-aggregator-on-electron).
  Until then: open the hub in the window where the work is
  happening.
- **Memory probe tab relocation question.** This design pass
  references the existing
  [`memory-probe.md`](../memory-probe/memory-probe.md) rather
  than relocating its content under `diagnostics/`. If future
  passes find the cross-doc reference structurally awkward, the
  memory-probe content can be relocated via `git mv` to
  `screens/diagnostics/memory-probe/` with inbound anchor sweeps.
  Not load-bearing for v1.

## Top-bar Actions menu

The hub's entry point is the Actions menu — a global affordance
specified in
[`patterns/actions-menu.md`](../../patterns/actions-menu.md). The
hub contributes a single entry, `Open Diagnostics Hub`, gated by
the diagnostics master toggle; the menu's broader inventory and
organization live in that pattern doc.
