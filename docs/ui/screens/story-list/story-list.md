# Story list (landing)

**Wireframe:** [`story-list.html`](./story-list.html) — interactive

The landing screen. First thing the user sees after onboarding, and
the home surface between writing sessions. Lists their stories with
enough at-a-glance info to recognize them, plus entry points for
creating new and managing the library.

Cross-cutting principles that govern this screen are in
[principles.md](../../principles.md). Relevant sections:

- [Top-bar design rule](../../principles.md#top-bar-design-rule)
  (universal essentials — with `← Return` absent here because this
  IS the root)
- [Actions](../../principles.md#actions--platform-agnostic-action-directory) menu
- [Settings architecture — split by location](../../principles.md#settings-architecture--split-by-location)
  (gear opens App Settings here, not Story Settings)

## Top-bar — app-level, lean

Landing is root. Only two essentials from the top-bar rule apply:

- **Actions** (⎇) — Cmd/Ctrl-K directory of all commands, reachable
  on every screen.
- **App Settings** (⚙) — opens the App Settings area (not Story
  Settings — no story context here).

Absent: return arrow (this is root), branch chip (no story), gen
status (no story).

The app's name ("Aventuras") replaces the story-title breadcrumb
slot — serves as chrome identity, non-interactive (or routes to
landing from anywhere else, but we're already here).

## Toolbar

- **Search** — single input, left-anchored, takes available width up
  to ~360px. Scope: `title`, `description`, `definition.genre.label`,
  `tags`. Affordances per the
  [search-bar-scope pattern](../../patterns/lists.md#search-bar-scope).
- **[Filter chips](../../patterns/chips.md#chip--square-toggleable)**
  — single-select: `All` / `Favorited` / `Archived`.
  `All` hides archived by default (they only appear when the
  `Archived` filter is active). `Favorited` shows only favorites.
- **Sort dropdown** — `last-opened` (default) / `created` / `title`.
  Single-select. Lean picker on the right.

**Sort invariant:** within any filter, **favorited stories float to
the top**, matching the Layer 0 rule from the
[entity-list sort pattern](../../patterns/entity.md#entity-list-sort-order--static-four-layer).
Everything else sorts by the chosen key.

## Story card — text-first

Visual contract and compound API live in the
[StoryCard pattern](../../patterns/story-card.md); this section
covers the surface-specific narrative (text-first lean, click
behavior, draft handling).

Cards work beautifully **text-only**; covers are a nice-to-have
enhancement, not a requirement. Most users will never make a
cover, so the card design can't depend on one.

Grid: `auto-fill` at `minmax(280px, 1fr)`. 1–4+ columns per
viewport.

**Components:**

- **Thin colored left-edge strip** (4px) — mode-derived by default
  (`Adventure` blue, `Creative` purple), override via a user-set
  `accentColor` field on the story. Gives scannable visual variety
  without requiring cover art.
- **Genre overline** — small uppercase label above the title,
  newspaper-section style. Colored to match the accent. Sourced from
  `definition.genre.label` (read via `json_extract`; the underlying
  `stories.definition` JSON shape carries `genre` as a
  preset+prose compound — see
  [`data-model.md → Story settings shape`](../../../data-model.md#story-settings-shape)).
  Rendered verbatim: `Fantasy` / `Dark Fantasy` / `Medieval Mystery`
  / `Folk Horror` / `Slice of Life with Magic` — whatever the user
  set as the label (typically a preset display name; user-editable).
  For drafts with no genre label yet, shows a muted "Genre not set"
  placeholder.
- **Title row** — title (bold), with a **favorite star inline
  before the title** that's a clickable toggle: outline + muted
  for non-favorited (~25% opacity, reveals on hover), filled gold
  for favorited. Clicking flips the state. Favorite is the only
  menu action promoted to inline chrome because it's frequent
  enough to earn a dedicated affordance. `Draft` or `Archived`
  status badges appear inline after the title when applicable.
- **Overflow menu (⋯)** — anchored to the **card's top-right
  corner** (absolute-positioned), out of the title row so titles
  don't compete with it. Click opens a menu with:
  - **Archive / Unarchive** (toggle)
  - **Edit info** — boots the story and routes directly to Story
    Settings → About for fast metadata edits. The first ← Return
    is [stack-aware](../../principles.md#stack-aware-return) and
    goes back to the library.
  - **Duplicate** — clone the story row + current branch's
    entries + entities/lore snapshot. Other branches don't copy.
  - **Export** — per-story JSON export (distinct from full
    backup, per data-model decision)
  - **Delete** — destructive, confirmation required, shown last
    Favorite/Unfavorite is NOT in this menu — it's the inline star toggle.
    These are per-card actions and do not appear in the global
    [Actions menu](../../patterns/actions-menu.md), which lists
    only self-contained commands; the Story List's Actions entries
    are `New story` and `Import story…`.
- **Meta row** — mode name (written out: "Adventure" / "Creative"),
  current chapter (for active stories), last-opened relative time.
  Draft stories skip the chapter part — their draft-ness is already
  signaled by the `Draft` badge in the title row.
- **Description** — 3 lines with ellipsis overflow (more generous
  than chip-heavy cards). For stories with no description yet,
  italic "(no description yet)".
- **No tag chips on the card.** Tags still exist in data for
  search/filter; they're not primary card content.
- **No cover area by default.** If/when a user sets a cover image,
  it can surface as a subtle background or a small thumbnail —
  deferred to the visual identity session.

**Click behavior:**

- Click card body → open the story (route to Reader).
- Click ⋯ → open the per-story overflow menu (favorite, archive,
  duplicate, export, delete, "add cover image…").

## Drafts — wizard session + explicit draft

Two complementary concepts that together make creating a story
forgiving without cluttering the library.

### Unfinished wizard session (automatic safety net)

- Zustand with persist (SQLite-backed) continuously saves wizard
  state on every step change. Persistence begins on the first
  meaningful state change (a field commit or `Next` click) — opening
  the wizard, glancing at it, and cancelling does NOT create a
  session.
- **One active session at a time** — the latest unfinished wizard
  attempt. The session is mutually exclusive with any specific
  wizard target (fresh `+ New story` OR an existing draft).
- Survives app restart.
- **Concurrent-state prompts** — both wizard entry paths trigger
  the same prompt shape when a session exists:
  - **`+ New story` while session exists** → prompt:
    `[Continue]` (resume session) /
    `[Discard session & start fresh]` (discard session, open fresh
    wizard).
  - **Click a draft card while session exists** → prompt:
    `[Continue session]` (resume session, draft click no-ops) /
    `[Discard session & open <DraftName>]` (discard session, open
    the picked draft).

  Destructive labeling makes the loss explicit. Users with valuable
  in-flight state can dismiss the prompt → return to wizard via
  `+ New story` (re-fires prompt → `Continue`) → save-as-draft
  explicitly → re-trigger their original click. A future
  third-button bridge (`[Save session as draft & continue]`) is
  parked-until-signal per
  [parked.md → Wizard concurrent-state prompt third button](../../../parked.md#wizard-concurrent-state-prompt-third-button).

- **No library presence** — session state is not a `stories` row;
  it's transient wizard state, separate from the library.

### Explicit "Save as draft" (parked work)

- Button inside the wizard at any step.
- Creates a real `stories` row with `status = 'draft'`.
- Session state clears; user returns to story list.
- Draft appears in the library as a card with a `Draft` badge.
- **Many drafts allowed** — user can park multiple parallel ideas.
- Clicking a draft re-opens the wizard **pre-populated** with that
  draft's state; further edits update the same row.
- Completing the wizard transitions `status: draft → active`.
- Drafts can be deleted like any story (⋯ menu → Delete).

### Why both

The session covers "I got interrupted / closed the app by accident"
— nothing is ever lost. The explicit draft covers "I want to park
this idea and come back deliberately, maybe start another one in
parallel." Different failure modes / use cases, both light on the
user.

### Draft visual treatment

- Inline `Draft` badge next to the title (same pattern as `Archived`,
  yellow tint).
- Title reads `Untitled story` (muted) if the wizard's `title` field
  is empty at save-as-draft time. User can rename when they resume.
- Genre overline reads "Genre not set" (muted) if
  `definition.genre.label` is empty.
- Meta line shows "draft · 0 entries".
- Left-edge accent still renders per mode (even draft stories have
  a chosen mode).
- Visible in the default `All` filter (they're active work-in-progress,
  should be discoverable).

## Story import

`.avts` files are imported via an **Import story** affordance in the
header next to `+ New story`. File picker opens; selected file's
`formatVersion` is validated, then the story (including branches,
entities, lore, threads, happenings, chapters, deltas, entry-asset
references) is materialized into the library as a new row.

Legacy `.avt` files (old-app format) are accepted but route through
a migration pass — see
[`followups.md → Legacy .avt migration import`](../../../parked.md#legacy-avt-migration-import).

See [patterns → Import counterparts](../../patterns/data.md#import-counterparts--file-based--vault)
for the cross-cutting pattern (versioning, zod validation, Vault
parallelism).

## Banner — AI configuration

This screen is the host for the persistent app-level banners (AI
not configured, profile errors). Both contracts — copy, CTA
routing, mutual-exclusion priority, why there's no "Resume setup"
path — live in
[principles → Persistent app-level banners](../../principles.md#persistent-app-level-banners).
Per-screen note: the banner sits above the toolbar, never replaces
content, and is non-dismissible (the underlying state is the
dismiss).

## Empty state (first launch)

When the user has zero stories (first launch, or after deleting
all), the grid is replaced with a centered welcome:

- Illustration slot (visual identity landing).
- **Welcome to Aventuras** heading.
- Short copy pitching the product and reinforcing the local-first
  story.
- Big CTA: `+ Create your first story` — same destination as the
  header CTA, but scaled for first-impression weight.

The toolbar (search / filter / sort) hides in empty state — nothing
to search/filter. The `+ New story` header button also hides since
the centered CTA carries that role more prominently.

## Mobile expression

Renders per the
[mobile foundations contracts](../../foundations/mobile/README.md).
Single-pane surface — no master-detail collapse rule applies.
Tablet inherits desktop verbatim per
[navigation.md → Tablet](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#tablet-6401023-px);
phone-tier specifics below.

- **Top-bar (root).** Logo on the left, no Return — root surface
  per
  [universal essentials](../../principles.md#universal-essentials).
  `[A] Aventuras` compresses on phone (smaller icon, smaller title
  font); right group keeps `⚲` (Actions) and `⚙` (App settings)
  per
  [navigation.md → Phone](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#phone--640-px).
- **List header row.** On phone, `[Import story…]` and
  `[+ New story]` wrap below the `Stories · N total` title; the
  two buttons stack horizontally beneath, or to two rows at 360 px
  if the row still overflows. No FAB; minimal-translation per
  [touch.md](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md).
- **Toolbar.** Search row, filter chips, sort picker — already
  `flex-wrap` on the surface; phone reflow lets each row break
  naturally. No behavior change.
- **Card grid.** `auto-fill minmax(280px, 1fr)` is already
  responsive (1 column phone, 2 tablet, 3–4 desktop). The retrofit
  wires container-query reflow; the existing grid CSS needs no
  shape change.
- **Favorite star.** Already implements
  [always-visible-muted](../../patterns/icon-actions.md#visibility--always-rendered-color-tiered-brighten-on-hover)
  (`opacity: 0.25` default, brighten on hover / focus on desktop).
  Touch users see the muted star without any hover state — exactly
  the canonical pattern per
  [touch.md → Hover translation](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#hover-translation).
- **`⋯` overflow menu.** Popover on desktop and tablet,
  **Sheet (short, bottom-anchored)** on phone per
  [layout.md → Surface bindings](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#surface-bindings--existing-app-surfaces).
  Same content (Archive / Edit info / Duplicate / Export / Delete);
  different primitive.
- **Search-help icon popover.** Stays Popover all tiers — tiny
  content fits the popover threshold per
  [layout.md → Decision tree](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#decision-tree).
- **Empty state.** Centered welcome card scales — illustration
  shrinks, copy retains line length, CTA stays full-width on phone
  for tap-target clarity.
- **Cards stay tappable, never tap-to-tooltip.** Card titles
  truncate but the card opens the story on tap; per
  [touch.md → Tap-to-tooltip on inert chrome text](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#tap-to-tooltip-on-inert-chrome-text)
  list rows and cards are explicitly out of scope.

## Data-model dependencies

Card identity fields — `tags`, `cover_asset_id`, `accent_color`,
`status`, `favorite`, `last_opened_at` — live as
columns on the `stories` table. The genre overline sources from
`definition.genre.label` (a JSON path into the `stories.definition`
column, not a top-level column). Schema authority and rationale in
[`data-model.md → Story identity fields`](../../../data-model.md#story-identity-fields)
and [`data-model.md → Story settings shape`](../../../data-model.md#story-settings-shape).

## Screen-specific open questions

- **Cover treatment when set** — see
  [`followups.md → Cover display on story list cards`](../../../parked.md#cover-display-on-story-list-cards).
- **Archived visibility**: currently `All` hides archived, `Archived`
  shows only archived. Alternative: `All` shows everything with
  archived dimmed. Current behavior keeps the library focused on
  active work.
- **Hover preview**: should hovering a card show a larger preview
  (fuller description, key entities, recent chapter summary)?
  Probably v2.
- **Bulk select on cards** — covered by
  [`followups.md → Bulk operations on entities`](../../../parked.md#bulk-operations-on-entities)
  (umbrella followup spans both World panel and story-list cards).
- **Genre label autocomplete**: the bundled preset catalog already
  surfaces common labels; an additional autocomplete drawn from
  labels used in other stories in this library could help
  consistency for user-typed labels. Lives on the Story Settings ·
  Generation tab editor, not on the library card.
- **Create flow entry point**: `+ New story` opens the
  [Story Creation Wizard](../wizard/wizard.md). Concurrent-state
  prompt rules (session vs draft) live in
  [Unfinished wizard session](#unfinished-wizard-session-automatic-safety-net)
  above.
