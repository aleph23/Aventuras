# World panel

**Wireframe:** [`world.html`](./world.html) — interactive

Dedicated full-screen surface for entities + lore management.
Master-detail pattern: filterable list on the left, single-row detail
on the right with tabs. The deep-edit workshop level of the
three-level entity surfacing (rail → peek → panel).

Cross-cutting principles that govern this panel are in
[principles.md](../../principles.md). Relevant sections:

- [Empty list / table state](../../patterns/lists.md#empty-list--table-state)
- [Actions menu (contextual zone)](../../patterns/actions-menu.md#contextual-zone)
  (World contributes per-entity / per-lore commands to the universal
  `⚲` directory)
  (centered placeholder when the active scope has zero rows;
  applies to the list pane AND the detail-pane Involvements +
  History tabs)

## Top-bar

Standard in-story chrome per
[principles → Top-bar design rule](../../principles.md#top-bar-design-rule).
Breadcrumb: `<story-title> / World`. The
[master-detail sub-header](../../principles.md#master-detail-sub-header)
below the top bar carries the in-pane selection
`[Characters|Locations|Items|Factions|Lore] / <selected name>`,
updating as the user clicks list rows.

## Detail head structure

Status selector is NOT chrome on the detail head; it's a typed form
field inside the Overview tab. The detail head carries only:

- A small breadcrumb strip: kind-icon + kind-name
- The entity name (inline-editable with pencil)
- A `Recently classified` badge — per
  [patterns → Recently-classified row accent](../../patterns/entity.md#recently-classified-row-accent).
- An overflow menu (⋯) anchored to the name row

The overflow menu holds rare-but-important actions:

- **Set as lead** (sets `stories.definition.leadEntityId`)
- **Export entity as JSON** (single-entity export)
- **View raw JSON** (debug/dev affordance)
- **Delete entity** (destructive; needs confirmation pass)

Raw JSON lives here (not as a prominent link) because it's
power-user/debug territory. One consistent pattern: ⋯ menus are where
"extra / rare" item-scoped actions live on any per-item surface.

## Tabs — per-kind composition

All four entity kinds share the same tab skeleton, rendered via the
[Tabs primitive](../../patterns/tabs.md) on tiers where the strip
fits and substituted to the Select primitive on narrower tiers.
Tabs distribute fields by **semantic purpose**, not by JS shape —
implemented as
[hand-written per-kind detail-pane components](../../patterns/entity.md#entity-detail-pane-composition):
`CharacterDetailPane`, `LocationDetailPane`, `ItemDetailPane`,
`FactionDetailPane`. Schema is the validation contract; UI owns
layout.

```
Overview | Identity | Carrying | Connections | Settings | Assets | Involvements | History
```

`Carrying` is **character-only** — hidden on location, item,
faction (no carry semantics). `Settings` applies to every kind
(every entity has status / injection_mode / retired_reason / tags).
Other tabs render for every kind with kind-specific content.

### Overview — glance summary, read-mostly

The Overview tab is a glance summary card, not the full form.
Click any region to route to the relevant edit tab. Doubles as
the [peek-drawer body](../reader-composer/reader-composer.md#peek-drawer--lead-affordance-for-characters)
at narrower (440px) width — same content, no duplicated design.

**Non-default injection-mode chip — applies to every kind.** A small
uppercase chip (`ALWAYS INJECTED` / `DISABLED`) sits inline next to
the status pill when `injection_mode` is non-default. Hidden for
the `auto` default to avoid noise on the common case;
surfaced for `always` and `disabled` because both diverge from
default in opposite directions and are operationally consequential.
Hover tooltip pulls from the same explanation as the Settings tab
select; click routes to Settings. Mirrors the conditional-surface
treatment used by `retired_reason` (visible only when
`status === 'retired'`).

**Character Overview** (top-down):

- Status pill (`active` / `staged` / `retired` + `retired_reason`
  inline when retired).
- Description prose — full text (typically 1-3 sentences). Click →
  Identity tab.
- Visual line — first 1-2 populated `visual.*` fields joined with
  `·`. Click → Identity / Visual.
- `TRAITS` and `DRIVES` chip rows — first ~3 of each with `+ N` overflow
  indicator. Click → Identity / Personality.
- `IN <location>` (current_location_id link) `· last seen N days ago`
  (from `lastSeenAt`). Click location → that entity's detail pane.
- `WITH <faction>` (faction_id link). Click → that faction's detail
  pane.
- Carrying summary — top stackables by quantity + equipped/carried
  counts in one line. Click → Carrying tab.
- Tags chip row — read-only on Overview; edits live on the
  Settings tab.
- Portrait — floats upper-right when populated; placeholder
  otherwise.

**Location Overview**:

- Status pill + location icon
- Description prose
- Parent chain — breadcrumb (`Shop in Town Square in City`) per
  [`LocationState.parent_location_id`](../../../data-model.md#locationstate-shape)
- `condition` — single line if populated
- "Characters here" count + first 3 portraits (links)
- "Items here" count + first few names
- Portrait slot
- Tags

**Item Overview**:

- Status pill + item icon
- Description prose
- `condition` — single line if populated
- Position — `at_location_id` link OR "Held by `<character>`"
  inverse-derived from any character's `equipped_items` /
  `inventory`
- Portrait slot
- Tags

**Faction Overview**:

- Status pill + faction icon
- Description prose
- `standing` — single line if populated
- Top agenda chips — top ~3 with overflow indicator
- Member count + first few member portraits (links from
  inverse-derived `character.faction_id`)
- Portrait slot
- Tags

Empty regions show `— not yet described —` style placeholders with
`add →` links into Identity. The Overview stays read-mostly even
when sparse.

### Identity — editable body of "who this is"

Identity is pure identity content — no operational chrome. Composed
top-down:

**Character Identity**:

- Description (textarea)
- `Visual` sub-section: `visual.physique`, `visual.face`,
  `visual.hair`, `visual.eyes`, `visual.attire` (live current —
  classifier-updated), `visual.distinguishing[]` (chip list)
- `Personality` sub-section: `traits[]`, `drives[]`, `voice`

**Location Identity**:

- Description
- `condition` (single-string, optional — dynamic state delta
  from description baseline)

**Item Identity**:

- Description
- `condition` (single-string, optional)

**Faction Identity**:

- Description
- `standing` (single-string, optional — dynamic power / situation)
- `agenda[]` (chip list, soft cap 4)

Faction's Identity is the closest in shape to character's, since
`standing` + `agenda` parallel `voice` + `drives`. Location and
Item are sparser (one dynamic field).

`status`, `injection_mode`, `retired_reason`, `tags`, and
`portrait` deliberately do not live here — see
[Settings](#settings--entity-management-chrome) and the Overview
portrait slot.

### Carrying — character-only

Composition (in order):

- `stackables` (`Record<string, number>`): chip row,
  `<key> × <count>` chips with `+ add`. Footnote retained
  ("Carried quantities — tracked on the character, not on
  container items").
- `equipped_items[]`: entity-ref list (picker-backed), labeled
  `Equipped`.
- `inventory[]`: entity-ref list, labeled `Carried`.

Tab is hidden entirely for non-character kinds.

### Connections — positional / compositional / affiliation / relationships

Per-kind sub-labels:

| Kind          | Sub-labels                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Character** | `Positional` (current_location_id) · `Affiliation` (faction_id) · `Relationships` (char→char) · `Last seen` (read-only) |
| **Location**  | `Compositional` (parent_location_id) · `Characters here` · `Items here` (inverse)                                       |
| **Item**      | `Positional` (at_location_id) · `Held by` (inverse from `character.equipped_items` / `inventory`)                       |
| **Faction**   | `Members` (inverse from `character.faction_id`) · inter-faction (deferred)                                              |

The tab name **Connections** is the umbrella for both structural
links (positional, affiliation) and social bonds. It was originally
slimmed from an older "Relationships" tab to be forward-compatible
when the char→char schema landed — see
[`patterns/entity.md`](../../patterns/entity.md#entity-detail-pane-composition).
The Relationships sub-section (below) is that landing.

`lastSeenAt` is classifier-only per the
[authorship contract](../../../data-model.md#authorship-contract);
read-only on the UI.

#### Relationships — character-to-character

Backed by the
[`character_relationships`](../../../data-model.md#character-to-character-relationships)
table. One row per other character the current character has a
recorded relationship with. Asymmetric perspectives render together
so the divergence — when present — is legible at a glance.

**Row composition** — uses the
[`ListRow`](../../patterns/lists.md) primitive:

- `leading` — [`EntityKindIcon`](../../patterns/entity.md#entity-kind-indicators--icons-not-text)
  for character.
- `label` — the other character's name.
- `description` — both perspectives, joined by `·`. The current
  character's view comes first; the other character's view second,
  prefixed for disambiguation. Null perspectives render as "not
  recorded" rather than blank — the gap is information.
- `trailing` — chevron (whole-row tap opens the edit sheet).

**Three perspective states** (mirrors the schema's `kind` /
`inverse_kind` nullability):

| State                 | `description` shape                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Both perspectives     | `sister · he sees you: brother`                 |
| Only self→other known | `mentor · their view: not recorded`             |
| Only other→self known | `your view: not recorded · they see you: rival` |

Pronouns default to "they / their" when the other character's
gender is unknown — the schema doesn't model gender, and pronoun
authoring is a downstream concern shared with any other place names
are referenced.

**Affordances:**

- **Add** — `+ Add relationship` row pinned at the bottom of the
  Relationships sub-section. Opens an edit sheet (composed from
  existing primitives): an `Autocomplete` over branch-scoped
  characters (excluding the current one) plus two text fields for
  `kind` (your view) and `inverse_kind` (their view). At least one of the two must be non-empty per the DB
  `CHECK` constraint; the form gates Save accordingly.
- **Edit** — whole-row tap opens the same sheet pre-filled.
- **Delete** — destructive action inside the edit sheet.
  Consistent with edit affordances elsewhere on World — destructive
  actions live in the editor, not on the row.

**Empty state.** When the character has no recorded relationships,
render the Relationships sub-section heading + an empty-state hint
("No relationships recorded yet") + the `+ Add relationship` row.
Sub-section is never hidden — discoverability of the affordance
matters even with empty data.

**Authoring contract reminder.** Classifier writes follow the same
v1 lean as the rest of CharacterState: the classifier UPSERTs based
on prose evidence, user edits stick only until contradicting prose.
The asymmetric two-field shape means each perspective is independent
— the classifier may update `kind` without touching `inverse_kind`
if the new prose only surfaces one side. See
[`data-model.md → Character-to-character relationships`](../../../data-model.md#character-to-character-relationships)
for the full authoring + UPSERT contract.

### Settings — entity-management chrome

Same fields for every kind:

- `status` (enum select): `active` / `staged` / `retired`. Edits
  here propagate to the Overview status pill.
- `injection_mode` (enum select with explanation): `always` /
  `auto` (default) / `disabled`. Includes the standard
  in-line explanation about scene-presence override.
- `retired_reason` (text, conditional): only enabled when
  `status === 'retired'`.
- `tags` (chip row with `+ add`): edit destination for the tags
  surfaced read-only on Overview.

Rationale for separating these fields from Identity lives in
[`patterns/entity.md → Why Settings is a separate tab`](../../patterns/entity.md#why-settings-is-a-separate-tab).

### Assets, Involvements, History

Unchanged from prior design.

- **Assets** — attached images / audio / files via `entry_assets`.
  Drop upload, pick from gallery, remove.
- **Involvements** — `happening_involvements` table for this
  entity. Rows link to happenings.
- **History** — delta log filtered to this entity. See
  [History tab](#history-tab) section below.

## List pane — search scope

Search is **category-aware** — scope changes with the active
category dropdown:

- **Characters / locations / items / factions** (entity rows) —
  per [`patterns/entity.md → Search scope`](../../patterns/entity.md#search-scope).
- **Lore**: `title`, `body`, `category`, `tags`

Affordances (placeholder + tooltip + ⓘ help icon) follow the
[search-bar-scope pattern](../../patterns/lists.md#search-bar-scope).

## Detail pane — raw JSON viewer

The `⋯ → View raw JSON` action opens the shared
[Raw JSON viewer](../../patterns/data.md#raw-json-viewer--shared-modal-pattern)
drawer. No World-specific deviation.

## Per-row import

The list-pane carries the EntityListPane affordance — minimalist
`[+]` icon-action right-anchored on the kind-selector row. Per-kind tooltip resolves to `New character`, `New location`,
`New item`, `New faction`, or `New lore` per the active category;
lore is not an entity, so the generic "New entity" copy would
mis-label the lore creation path.

The button follows the standard
[import-counterparts pattern](../../patterns/data.md#import-counterparts--file-based--vault)
(Blank / From JSON file… / From Vault…). JSON imports validate
against the kind's zod schema; mismatch fails with a friendly
error rather than a partial save.

## History tab

History is the delta log filtered to this entity: every change
(`op=create / update / delete`) that touched this `entity_id`. Never
editable — rollback happens in the reader. Row rendering follows
the [DeltaLogRow pattern](../../patterns/delta-log-row.md); host
resolves target display names and renders the diff summary
prose, then hands pre-formatted strings to the compound.

- **Search** — structured: `field-path strings`, `op`, and the
  rendered change-summary text. Backed by `LIKE` on
  `target_table` + `op` columns and `json_extract` over the
  `undo_payload` JSON. SQLite filters server-side; lazy-loaded
  delta log doesn't need to be fully in memory.
- **Op filter** — all / create / update / delete
- **Sort** — newest-first (default) or oldest-first
- **Load-older chunking** — log-shaped data; uses the
  [load-older pattern](../../patterns/lists.md#load-older--log-shaped-unbounded-lists)
  (explicit button), not virtualization.

Involvements table gets the same load-older pattern eventually; list
pane is fine unpaginated for normal stories (filter chips + search
handle it).

## Lore — separate kind

Lore lives in the `lore` table, not `entities`. Different schema,
different table, simpler than entities (more text-heavy, no
lifecycle, no scene presence, no actor semantics). The
detail-pane composition reflects the difference — fewer tabs,
simpler body shape, no Connections / Carrying / Assets /
Involvements analogs.

### Tab skeleton

```
Body | Settings | History
```

Three tabs. Settings + History parity with entity tabs preserves
the "this is a record-management surface, not just a content
editor" signal across kinds. Each absent tab is structurally
justified:

- No **Overview** — lore body is small enough to glance directly;
  no separate summary card needed.
- No **Carrying** — no holder semantics.
- No **Connections** — lore doesn't reference other entities;
  cross-lore via body text + tags + search.
- No **Assets** — parked until demand surfaces (per
  [`parked.md → Lore Assets`](../../../parked.md#lore-assets)).
- No **Involvements** — lore isn't an actor; doesn't participate in
  `happening_involvements`.

`Body` not `Identity`. `Identity` carries "who this is" framing
loaded for entities (description + visual + personality); lore has
subject matter, not identity. `Body` matches the schema field name
(`lore.body`) and reads as "the actual content of the lore entry."

### Detail head — lore

Mirrors the [entity detail head pattern](#detail-head-structure):

- Breadcrumb strip: kind-icon + "Lore"
- **Title** (inline-editable with pencil) — equivalent of the entity
  name slot. Edits dirty the save session.
- **Recently-classified badge** — per
  [`patterns/entity.md → Recently-classified row accent`](../../patterns/entity.md#recently-classified-row-accent).
  Lore is classifier-touched at chapter close via the
  lore-management agent (per
  [`data-model.md → Chapters / memory system`](../../../data-model.md#chapters--memory-system));
  the same accent rule applies.
- **Overflow menu (⋯)**: `Export lore as JSON`, `View raw JSON`,
  `Delete`. **No `Set as lead`** — lead is a character-only concept
  per [`principles → Mode, lead, and narration`](../../principles.md#mode-lead-and-narration--three-orthogonal-concepts).

### Body tab — lore

Two fields, no sub-sections.

- **Category** — single-row input at the top of the pane. Free-form
  text per the schema (`magic-system`, `religion`, `cosmology` are
  illustrative, not enumerated). On focus, a popover surfaces
  existing categories from this branch's lore as autocomplete
  suggestions, keeping casual taxonomy consistent without forcing
  an enum. Empty = `— uncategorized —` placeholder.
- **Body textarea** — fills the remaining vertical space. Plain
  text per the schema; no markdown rendering or rich-text in v1.
  Standard textarea grow / scroll behavior. **Body is required**
  (see [Required body](#required-body--creation--edit-invariant) below).

Category lives on Body, not Settings, because category is
content-classification (answers "what kind of lore is this") and
pairs with the body it labels. Tags live on Settings — they
compose with the cross-cutting search and filter scaffolding
(per [`patterns/lists.md → search-bar-scope`](../../patterns/lists.md#search-bar-scope))
and pair with entity tags for cross-kind parity.

### Settings tab — lore

Three fields, top-down:

- **`injection_mode`** (enum select with explanation): `always` /
  `auto` (default) / `disabled`. Same select primitive entities
  use, with the same in-line explanation about how each mode
  interacts with retrieval.
  - `always` — force-injected into every prompt. Use sparingly
    (token cost).
  - `auto` — surfaced when retrieval (keyword + embedding +
    LLM-fallback) finds relevance with the current scene. Default.
  - `disabled` — never injected; lore is read-only reference
    material for the user.
- **`priority`** (integer input, narrow; range `0..100`). Default `0`.
  Tooltip explains the working model: "Higher priority is preferred
  when retrieval is token-budget-constrained. Ties break by recency.
  Semantics firmed up in the memory design pass: priority is 0-100,
  integrated into the ranker as
  `sim_blend × (priority/100) + kw_boost`. See
  [`docs/memory/retrieval.md → The ranker`](../../../memory/retrieval.md#the-ranker).
- **`tags`** (chip row with `+ add`): edit destination for tags
  surfaced read-only on glance / search. Same shape as entity tags.

What's not on lore Settings:

- No `status` / `retired_reason` — lore has no lifecycle.
- No `category` — content classification, not operational chrome
  (lives on Body).

### List sort — lore (static, two-layer)

No user sort controls — rule-driven and stable, mirroring the
entity sort philosophy at
[`patterns/entity.md → Entity list sort order`](../../patterns/entity.md#entity-list-sort-order--static-four-layer).

1. **Layer 1:** `priority` descending. Higher priority first.
2. **Layer 2 (tiebreaker):** `title` alphabetical.

Applies to both Browse rail and World list pane.

Priority-as-sort-key inherits the working-model caveat from the
priority-semantics open question. Until retrieval pins what
priority _does_, it pins what priority _means visually_ — "this
lore surfaces first in lists." If retrieval semantics later land
orthogonal to ranking, the sort still makes intuitive sense
(higher priority = "more important to the user") and doesn't need
to change.

### List filter — lore

**No filter chips.** Lore has no orthogonal categorical axes that
warrant chip-shaped filtering — no `status` lifecycle, no in-scene
concept, free-form `category` doesn't enumerate predictably. The
list-pane filter chip row is hidden when `Lore` is the active
list-pane category. Same applies to the Browse rail when its scope
filter targets lore.

A future "categories as dynamic chips" surface — distinct
`lore.category` values rendered as filter chips — is plausible at
high lore volume but premature now. No standalone followup unless
real volume signals demand.

### Required body — creation + edit invariant

A lore entry cannot exist with an empty `body`. Validation lives
at two places:

- **Body tab save** — save bar disables until body is non-empty.
- **Creation paths** (per [Per-row import](#per-row-import) /
  [`patterns/data.md → import-counterparts`](../../patterns/data.md#import-counterparts--file-based--vault)):
  - **Blank** — form must enforce body-non-empty before save bar
    enables.
  - **From JSON file** — Zod schema marks `body` required;
    mismatch fails the existing friendly-error path.
  - **From Vault** — vault entries already carry populated bodies
    (vault flow mostly deferred; verify when vault lands).

### History tab — lore

Same shape as the entity [History tab](#history-tab) — delta log
filtered to `target_table = lore` and this `lore_id`. Search +
op-filter + sort + load-older chunking all carry over. Lore
writes (user edits + lore-management agent at chapter close) all
flow through the delta log per the standard authorship contract,
so the History tab surface is uniform across the kinds with no
lore-specific deviation.

## Collision review and entity merge

The classifier writes `name_collision_flag = true` on a
freshly-created entity when the prose-extracted description
didn't match an existing same-name entity strongly enough to
promote the existing one. The flag means "this could be a
duplicate; the user should decide." Schema and classifier rules
live in
[`memory/edge-cases.md → Name collision`](../../../memory/edge-cases.md#name-collision-and-disambiguation).

The World panel is the only surface where the flag is resolved.
Three resolution paths are offered: **merge** the two rows into
one canonical entity, **rename** one to make them genuinely
distinct, or **keep as distinct** and accept both same-name rows.
Lore has no collision flag — only the four entity kinds
(character / location / item / faction) carry it.

### Surfacing

A collision flag is a "do something" signal, not a "narrow your
view" signal. Chrome appears wherever the flag exists; no extra
discovery step.

1. **Top-bar review pill** — when one or more entities on the
   current branch carry `name_collision_flag = true`, a
   `⚠ N need review` pill renders inline in the World top-bar,
   alongside the
   [generation status pill](../../principles.md#universal-in-story-chrome).
   Warn-tinted to distinguish. Hidden when N=0. Click → scrolls
   the list-pane to the first flagged row (and expands its
   accordion group if collapsed). On phone the label collapses
   to glyph + count (`⚠ N`) parallel to the gen pill.
2. **Per-row collision strip — always visible on flagged rows.**
   Each flagged row carries an inline strip below the standard
   row composition: `⚠ Collides with <other-name>` link plus a
   `Resolve →` button. Renders unconditionally — no filter
   activation, no extra tap to expose. Flagged rows show signal
   in-place wherever they live in the list (Active, Staged, or
   Retired group), warn-tinted so they read distinct from the
   surrounding rows. The strip is row-conditional (renders only
   on flagged rows), so unflagged rows stay decoration-clean and
   the
   [four-channel rule](../../patterns/entity.md#entity-row-indicators--four-orthogonal-channels)
   isn't violated for the common case.
3. **Collapsed-accordion badge** — when an accordion group
   (Active / Staged / Retired) is collapsed AND contains one or
   more flagged rows, the group header carries a small
   `⚠ N` count badge to the right of the group count. Keeps
   the signal visible without overriding the user's manual
   collapse intent. Click the badge → expands the group and
   scrolls to its first flagged row. Hidden when the group is
   expanded (the strips themselves are visible) or when the
   group has no flagged rows.

The pill is the at-a-glance count and jump target. The strip is
the action surface. The badge is the bridge — keeps signal
visible when accordions hide rows.

A "Needs review" filter chip was considered and rejected:
filter chips are for browsing modes, and a collision is an
attention signal. Filtering layered an extra tap between the
user and the action with no compensating browsing benefit.

### Resolve dialog

`Resolve →` opens a modal anchored to the World panel. Header
states the collision (`⚠ Two characters named "Kael"`) and
offers the three resolution paths as a primary action picker:

```
[ Merge into one ] [ Rename one ] [ Keep as distinct ]
```

Default is `Merge` — the most common intended resolution. Each
path collapses the dialog to a different body shape (below).
All paths are dismissible without writes (`Cancel` in the footer
or Esc).

#### Merge

The body renders the two rows side-by-side with a **canonical
picker** at the top: a segment toggle picking which row's `id`
survives. The non-canonical row is deleted at end-of-merge.
Default selection is the older row by `created_at` — the older
row tends to have more accumulated state (relations, lore
links, history), so absorbing the newer one into it preserves
more by default.

Below the picker, a **per-field resolution table** lists fields
that diverge between the two:

| field        | side A (canonical)                                          | side B                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| description  | (•) wandering swordsman…                                    | ( ) guardsman at city gate… |
| status       | (•) active                                                  | ( ) active                  |
| `tags[]`     | union (default) — deselect per conflicting tag              |                             |
| `state` JSON | follows the canonical row · edit on detail pane after merge |                             |

Field-level rules:

- **Divergent fields only.** Identical values on both sides
  don't render — there's no decision to make. The table lists
  only fields where side A and side B differ.
- **Top-level scalars** (`name`, `description`, `status`,
  `retired_reason`, `injection_mode`) — radio per row when
  divergent.
- **`tags[]`** — union by default with a per-tag deselect.
  Renders only when the two tag sets differ.
- **`state` JSON** — taken whole-side from canonical. Per-field
  diff inside `state` is out of scope for v1: schema shape
  varies per kind (character / location / item / faction),
  traversal/diff UI gets complex fast, and the canonical-picker
  default already encodes "older row's state wins." When the
  user wants the newer row's state, picking it as canonical and
  then editing top-level scalars from the loser is a clean
  two-step path. Surfaced as an inline note.
- **Long-text values.** Description and other prose-shaped
  fields wrap freely on desktop (modal scrolls). On mobile, a
  3-line clamp applies with a "..." trailing truncation; tap
  the prose body to expand the row in place. Radios stay tappable
  independently — the tap zone splits between the radio circle
  and the prose body. Keeps comparison glance-able when prose
  diverges in length.
- **Side identification.** Desktop column headers (`side A
(canonical)` / `side B`) carry side identity. On mobile the
  headers collapse out of view, so each radio's value carries an
  inline meta caption (`12 turns ago` / `this turn`, same wording
  as the canonical picker) underneath the prose. Each radio is
  self-describing without relying on column position.

A **relations summary** below the field table tells the user
what will move (read-only — relations always follow the
canonical id):

- `Awareness rows: <N>` from non-canonical → canonical.
- `Involvements: <N>` from non-canonical → canonical.
- `Inverse refs: <N>` other entities point at non-canonical via
  `inventory[]`, `equipped_items[]`, `current_location_id`,
  `parent_location_id`, `at_location_id`, or `faction_id` —
  rewritten to canonical.
- `Embeddings: 1` vec0 row from non-canonical dropped (the
  canonical re-embeds if any of its embedded fields changed).
- `Translation rows: <N>` from non-canonical → canonical.

UNIQUE-constraint handling is deterministic and not
user-facing: when an awareness row from non-canonical would
collide on `(branch_id, character_id, happening_id)` with an
existing canonical row, the canonical's row stays and the
loser's row is dropped. Documented inline in the relations
summary as a footnote when the case fires.

Footer:

```
[ Cancel ]                  [ Merge into <canonical-name> ]
```

The primary button echoes the canonical pick to keep the
destructive direction obvious.

#### Rename

Body is a single inline rename form, two rows stacked:

```
char_a1b2c3… (older, 12 turns ago):  [ Kael                       ]
char_d4e5f6… (newer, this turn):     [ Kael (the guardsman)       ]
```

Editing either field dirties the form. Save commits both rows
under one delta `action_id`; the flag clears on the
formerly-flagged row. No additional reconciliation — both rows
continue to exist unchanged except for the one that got
renamed.

Validation: at least one of the two names must change
(otherwise the collision is unresolved). Save disables until
that holds.

#### Keep as distinct

Body is a confirmation panel:

> Both `Kael` entities will continue to exist with the same
> name. Retrieval treats them by id, but storyteller responses
> may conflate them in prose. Polymorphic naming is a
> documented v1 limitation
> ([`edge-cases.md → Polymorphic naming`](../../../memory/edge-cases.md#polymorphic-naming--v1-limitation))
> — the schema doesn't enforce unique names. The flag clears;
> no other writes.

Footer:

```
[ Cancel ]                              [ Keep as distinct ]
```

Confirming clears the flag on the newer row without writing
anything else. The user is opting into the v1 limitation with
eyes open.

### Reversibility

All three paths write deltas under a single `action_id` so
[CTRL-Z rollback](../../../data-model.md#entry-mutability--rollback)
unwinds the resolution as one step.

Merge writes:

- `entities` op=`update` on canonical (changed fields).
- `entities` op=`delete` on non-canonical (full
  `undo_payload` carries the row).
- `happening_awareness` op=`update`/`delete` per affected row.
- `happening_involvements` op=`update`/`delete` per affected
  row.
- `entities` op=`update` on every other entity that held an
  inverse ref to non-canonical (state JSON paths rewritten).
- `translations` op=`update` per affected row.

Embeddings are not delta-logged
([`data-model.md → embeddings`](../../../data-model.md#diagram)) —
the loser's vec0 row is dropped silently; on rollback the
restored entity row re-embeds via the standard
[eager-sync-on-write contract](../../../memory/retrieval.md#compute-lifecycle).
The user-visible behavior is "merge is reversible" — the
non-trivial wiring lives below the surface.

Rename and keep-as-distinct are similarly grouped and unwind
identically.

### Edit restrictions during in-flight generation

The resolve dialog is a write surface; per
[`principles.md → Edit restrictions during in-flight generation`](../../principles.md#edit-restrictions-during-in-flight-generation),
the `Resolve →` button is disabled while narrative or
chapter-close generation is running, with the same disabled-
tooltip language as the entity save bar. The pill and filter
chip stay visible — discovery isn't gated, only the write.

### Authorship and 3+ collisions

Resolution writes deltas with `source = user_edit`. The flag
itself is classifier-written
([authorship contract](../../../data-model.md#authorship-contract)
keeps `name_collision_flag` on the classifier side); resolution
is always user-authored.

The dialog handles two-side merges only. When 3+ entities
collide on the same name, the user iterates: resolve any pair,
the remaining pair re-surfaces in the filter view on the next
open. N-way merge UI is not v1.

## Mobile expression

Phone forces master-detail collapse: list-first by default, detail
opens as a full-screen route within the World surface, back returns
to list. Tablet inherits the desktop 2-pane layout cramped at the
narrow end (~430 px detail pane on iPad portrait); detail-pane tab
nav reroutes to the Select primitive when the desktop tab strip
overflows.

- **Master-detail collapse on phone** per
  [`mobile/collapse.md → Two-pane navigation surfaces (World, Plot, Settings)`](../../foundations/mobile/collapse.md#two-pane-navigation-surfaces-world-plot-settings).
  List visible by default; row tap navigates to detail as a
  full-screen route (back-on-left returns to list state). The
  master-detail sub-header (`Characters / Kael Vex`) sits below
  the slim phone top bar at the route level.
- **Top-bar shape on phone** per
  [`mobile/navigation.md → Phone`](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#phone--640-px):
  slim single-row `[←] [<title> / World] [pill] [⛭] [⚲]`. List
  state breadcrumb is `<title> / World`; detail-route extends to
  `<title> / World / <kind>` (parent segments tappable per the
  breadcrumb-tappability amendment, current segment inert with
  tap-to-tooltip on truncation per
  [`mobile/touch.md`](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#tap-to-tooltip-on-inert-chrome-text)).
- **Detail-pane tab navigation reroutes on narrow widths.** Tab
  strip is the desktop primitive; on tablet detail panes that
  can't fit the full strip (count > 3 — character at 8, location /
  item / faction at 7), and on phone always, the tab list hands
  off to the Select primitive's render-mode cascade per
  [`patterns/forms.md → Select primitive`](../../patterns/forms.md#select-primitive).
  The cascade picks segment mode for ≤ 2 options on phone, dropdown
  otherwise. Phone-tier dropdown opens via Sheet (short) per
  [`mobile/layout.md → Surface bindings`](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#surface-bindings--existing-app-surfaces);
  tablet-tier dropdown opens via anchored Popover. Same data,
  different primitive — analogous to the Reader rail's tier-aware
  swap. Lore (3 tabs): Tab strip on desktop and tablet, Select
  dropdown on phone (3 > 2, the mobile cardinality cutoff).
- **List-pane category dropdown** (`[Characters ▾]`) is already a
  custom Select component (not a native `<select>`); on phone the
  dropdown render mode opens via Sheet (short) per the same binding
  as the tab dropdown. Five flat categories — fits the short-Sheet
  threshold cleanly.
- **List-pane chrome** stacks vertically on phone — search input
  one row, filter chips wrapping below via the existing
  `flex-wrap` rule. No layout change.
- **Detail-head overflow menu (`⋯`)** binds to Popover on desktop /
  tablet, Sheet (short) on phone per
  [`mobile/layout.md → Surface bindings`](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#surface-bindings--existing-app-surfaces).
  Same content (`Set as lead` / `Export entity as JSON` /
  `View raw JSON` / `Delete entity`). Lore detail-head omits
  `Set as lead` (per the existing per-kind note); rule otherwise
  identical.
- **Per-row import affordance** — the EntityListPane `[+]`
  icon-action reads naturally on phone too (touch-tier hit area
  per the icon-actions touch-tier minimum). The import-counterparts
  dropdown (`Blank` / `From JSON file…` / `From Vault…`) opens
  as Sheet (short) on phone per the layout binding for
  popover-style menus.
- **Raw JSON viewer** inherits the binding-table mapping: Sheet
  (right ~440 px) on desktop, Sheet (bottom, tall ~95 %) on phone
  per [`mobile/layout.md → Surface bindings`](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#surface-bindings--existing-app-surfaces).
- **Overview portrait reflows on phone.** The detail-head portrait
  slot floats at 220 px upper-right on desktop and tablet; on
  phone that eats ~56 % of the 390 px viewport, squeezing
  description prose. Phone tier: portrait stacks below the prose
  at ~100 px, matching the peek-drawer compact-head shape (glance
  content first, visual reference below). Tap the portrait to
  view it full-size per
  [`principles.md → Tap a thumbnail to see it full-size`](../../principles.md#tap-a-thumbnail-to-see-it-full-size).
- **Form-field rows** follow the
  [stacked-on-narrow-container rule](../../patterns/forms.md#form-rows--stacked-on-narrow-container)
  shared with story-settings, app-settings, plot, and vault
  calendars — 2-col grid (180 px label-left / 1fr input-right,
  uppercase monospace label) when the form container is
  `≥ 640 px`, stacked single-column block (sentence-case sans
  label above, full-width input below) when the form container
  is `< 640 px`. Phone and tablet portrait detail panes stack;
  tablet landscape and desktop stay 2-col. Type-hint applies
  `overflow-wrap: anywhere` so long monospace strings break
  cleanly when 2-col is active.
- **History tab controls reflow on narrow widths.** The
  `.history-controls` row (search input, op-filter chips, sort
  picker) is a single horizontal row at desktop tier; on tablet
  and phone it `flex-wrap`s, with the search input taking its own
  full-width row first and the filter and sort chips wrapping
  beneath. Prevents the search field from collapsing to a
  multi-line vertical block at narrow widths.
- **Save bar on phone** stays at the bottom edge of the
  detail-route's scroll region per
  [`patterns/save-sessions.md`](../../patterns/save-sessions.md);
  hides while the keyboard is open per
  [`mobile/touch.md → Save bar on phone`](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#save-bar-on-phone),
  reappears on field blur. Navigate-away guard stays active
  throughout including during keyboard-open.
- **Stack-aware Return** binds the chrome `←`, Android
  `BackHandler`, and iOS swipe-back to the existing pop-one-level
  semantics per
  [`mobile/navigation.md → Stack-aware Return`](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#stack-aware-return-on-mobile).
  List ↔ detail navigation is a sub-stack within the World
  surface; back from detail routes to list, not to the prior
  top-level surface. Dirty-state save-session guard fires before
  the back action per
  [`patterns/save-sessions.md`](../../patterns/save-sessions.md).
- **Phone landscape** (~700–900 px) lands in tablet tier per the
  [responsive contract](../../foundations/mobile/responsive.md).
  2-pane (list ~340 px, detail ~360–560 px); cramped but usable.
  Tab-strip overflow rule applies per the tablet column.
- **Resolve dialog reflows** to Sheet (tall ~95 %) on phone per
  [`mobile/layout.md → Surface bindings`](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#surface-bindings--existing-app-surfaces).
  The merge body's three-column field grid
  ([Merge](#merge)) collapses to single column: each divergent
  field renders as a section (field name as section header,
  side A radio + value, side B radio + value, each with its own
  meta caption to retain side identity). Column headers (`field`
  / `side A` / `side B`) hide on mobile — the per-section
  structure carries the layout. Canonical picker stacks
  vertically (segments full-width). Long-prose values clamp to
  3 lines with tap-to-expand. Relations summary stays
  single-column; always vertical. Action footer pins to the
  Sheet bottom.
- **Top-bar review pill** collapses on phone parallel to the
  [generation pill](../../principles.md#universal-in-story-chrome).
  The `need review` label drops; the warn glyph and the count
  number stay (`⚠ N`) so the at-a-glance signal survives without
  competing with the breadcrumb and actions cluster for line
  space. Full label returns at tablet+. The collapsed pill stays
  click-targetable — same affordance as desktop.
- **Per-row collision strip** wraps cleanly on phone — the
  collide-with link and Resolve button drop to a second row
  inside the strip when the row width can't fit them.
- **Collapsed-accordion badge** stays inline with the group
  header on phone. Group headers reflow no differently from
  their unflagged counterparts; the badge sits after the count
  in the same row.
