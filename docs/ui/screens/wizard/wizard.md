# Story creation wizard

**Wireframe:** [`wizard.html`](./wizard.html) — interactive

The canonical creation path from `+ New story` to first reader
entry. Five-step linear-with-back-jump flow that authors a
complete story (definition + initial cast + initial lore +
opening) in one atomic commit.

Cross-cutting principles that govern this surface live in
[principles.md](../../principles.md). Relevant sections:

- [Mode, lead, and narration](../../principles.md#mode-lead-and-narration--three-orthogonal-concepts)
  (cross-field constraint enforced at step 4 / step 5)
- [Settings architecture — split by location](../../principles.md#settings-architecture--split-by-location)
  (definitional fields wizard-authored, operational copies from
  app defaults)
- [Icon-actions pattern](../../patterns/icon-actions.md) (governs
  ✕ / ⭐-set-as-lead row affordances on the cast and lore lists)

Design rationale, alternatives explored, and adversarial findings
in [`explorations/2026-04-30-story-creation-wizard.md`](../../../explorations/2026-04-30-story-creation-wizard.md).

```

Full-page replacement. App's normal top-bar (Actions / Settings
gear / story breadcrumb) is hidden — wizard chrome IS the action
vocabulary.

## Top-bar shell

Wizard-specific:

- **`← Cancel`** (top-left) — returns to story-list, **preserves
  the auto-saved session** (per
  [story-list.md → Concurrent-state prompts](../story-list/story-list.md#unfinished-wizard-session-automatic-safety-net)).
  Window/tab close has identical semantics.
- **`New story · step N of 5`** centered — title with step counter.
  Replaces the usual story-title breadcrumb (no story exists yet).
- **No `Actions ⎇` menu, no `⚙` Settings gear.** Wizard isn't a
  story context, the chrome IS the action surface, and a
  near-empty Actions menu would be worse than no menu.

## Step indicator

Horizontal pill row below the top-bar:

- **Filled dot (●)** = completed step.
- **Hollow dot (○)** = pending.
- **Active step** gets accent treatment.
- **Backward-jump clickable** on completed pills.
- **Forward-jump disabled** — must advance via `Next →` (which
  validates current step).
- **Auto-save** fires on any nav (Next / Back / pill click).

Named-not-numbered: 5 steps fit comfortably; names give spatial
sense ("ah, almost done, on Opening").

## Footer

```
[Save as draft]                                [← Back]  [Next →]
```

- **`Save as draft`** — anywhere in flow. Creates `stories` row
  with `status='draft'`, clears auto-save session, returns to
  story-list. Validation does NOT gate save-as-draft.
- **`← Back`** — previous step. Hidden on step 1.
- **`Next →`** — advances on validation pass. On step 5, becomes
  **`Finish`** — fires the atomic commit.

## Save / cancel / draft semantics

| Action                | Auto-save session | `stories` row created   | Where user lands                |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Next`                | updated           | no                      | next step                       |
| `← Back` / pill click | updated           | no                      | target step                     |
| `Save as draft`       | cleared           | yes (`status='draft'`)  | story-list (draft card visible) |
| `← Cancel`            | preserved         | no                      | story-list                      |
| Window/tab close      | preserved         | no                      | (n/a)                           |
| `Finish`              | cleared           | yes (`status='active'`) | reader-composer with story open |

**Auto-save session** persists only after the first meaningful
state change. Opening the wizard, glancing, and cancelling does
NOT create a session.

**Concurrent-state prompts** (session vs draft mutual exclusion)
live in [story-list.md → Unfinished wizard session](../story-list/story-list.md#unfinished-wizard-session-automatic-safety-net).
Both `+ New story` and click-a-draft trigger the same prompt
shape when a session exists.

## Step 1 — Frame

Step heading: **How is this story told?**

Two segment pickers ([Select primitive](../../patterns/forms.md#select-primitive)
in `segment` render mode):

- **Mode** — `Adventure` / `Creative`. Two-line cells: label +
  pithy explanation.
  - Adventure: "You play a character. AI runs the world."
  - Creative: "You write the prose. AI helps draft."
- **Narration** — `First` / `Second` / `Third`. Two-line cells.
  - First: `"I drew…"`
  - Second: `"You drew…"`
  - Third: `"Aria drew…"`

**Cross-field forward-pointer.** When `mode='adventure'` OR
`narration ∈ {first, second}`, an inline informational chip
appears beneath the pickers:

> ⓘ This combination will require a lead character in Cast.

Surfacing the consequence at the choice site lets users
self-correct early. Forward-pointer phrasing avoids alarmism for
what's a normal flow.

**Defaults.** `mode='creative'`, `narration='third'` — the most
permissive combination, no lead required.

**`← Back` hidden** on step 1.

**No AI-assist** — both pickers are short enumerated options.

**Future growth slot.** Image modes / HTML formatting / other
output-shape decisions land in this step when shipped, without
restructuring the wizard.

## Step 2 — Calendar

Step heading: **When does this story take place?**

The calendar picker primitive is canonical in
[`patterns/calendar-picker.md`](../../patterns/calendar-picker.md).
The wizard hosts it with:

- **Picker dropdown** + **always-visible adjacent summary panel**.
- **No `Manage calendars in Vault →` tail** (mid-wizard nav to
  Vault is out of scope).

```
Calendar system
<copy>
[picker dropdown — Earth (Gregorian) ▾]   [summary panel adjacent]

Story start moment
<copy>
{tier-derived inputs}
```

### `worldTimeOrigin` input — tier-derived

The input form is **derived from the picked calendar's `tiers[]`**.
One control per tier, top-down, in a horizontal row (wraps on
narrow viewports):

- **Tier without `labels`** → numeric input. Validates per the
  tier's `rollover` (range computed cascading from coarser tiers).
- **Tier with `labels`** → dropdown rendering the labeled values.
  Selection writes the underlying integer value into the tuple.

Examples:

| Calendar               | Inputs (top-down)                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Earth (Gregorian)      | `Year` numeric · `Month` dropdown · `Day` numeric · `Hour` numeric · `Minute` numeric · `Second` numeric |
| Shire Reckoning        | `Year` numeric · `Month` dropdown · `Day` numeric                                                        |
| Stardate               | `count` numeric                                                                                          |
| Warhammer 40K Imperial | `Millennium` numeric · `Fractional year` numeric                                                         |

Runtime reads `Tier.labels`, `Tier.startValue`, `Tier.rollover`
and renders accordingly. Wizard never hard-codes per-calendar
shapes.

**Defaults.** Initial `calendarSystemId` = `app_settings.default_calendar_id`
(copy-at-creation pattern). Initial `worldTimeOrigin` = the picked
calendar's mandatory
[`exampleStartValue`](../../../calendar-systems/spec.md#calendar-definition)
`TierTuple`.

### Calendar swap inside wizard

If user changes the calendar pick after editing the origin:

- **Disjoint tier sets** (Earth → Stardate): origin tuple resets
  to new calendar's `exampleStartValue`. Inline notice:
  `Origin reset for the new calendar.`
- **Subset match** (Earth → Shire): preserve overlapping tier
  values, drop tiers not in the new shape. No notice.
- **Superset** (Shire → Earth): preserve overlapping, fill
  missing tiers from new calendar's `exampleStartValue`.

No swap warning modal here (unlike Story Settings) — wizard's
swap is always re-pick during construction; no in-flight story
state to protect.

### Validation gate on `Next`

All required tiers must have valid values per their `rollover`
rules (e.g., day ≤ month-length for Earth Gregorian). Inline
error per-input on blur; `Next →` blocks until clean.

### No AI-assist

Origin is a specific date — AI suggestions would be guessing.

## Step 3 — World

Step heading: **What's the world like?**

Four sections, vertical scroll:

### Genre / Tone — preset + prose hybrid

```
Genre
[label input]                       [📚 Browse presets]  [✨]
[promptBody textarea — multi-paragraph]

Tone
[label input]                       [📚 Browse presets]  [✨]
[promptBody textarea]
```

Three input paths per field, all writing into `{ label, promptBody }`:

1. **Manual** — user types both directly.
2. **Browse presets** (`📚`) — opens picker popover with bundled
   presets. Each row: `displayName · 1-line tagline · preview body`
   on hover. Pick → copies to label + promptBody.
3. **AI-suggest** (`✨`) — see [AI-assist pattern](#ai-assist-pattern).
   Result is **prose** (label preview + body preview together).

**Replace-on-existing.** If the user picks a preset OR accepts an
AI-suggest while `label` or `promptBody` is non-empty, a confirm
modal fires:

```
Replace genre with "Hard sci-fi"?
Your current label and body will be lost.
                           [Cancel]  [Replace]
```

v1 safeguard against accidental loss.

### Setting — freeform

```
Setting                                              [✨]
[setting textarea — multi-paragraph freeform prose]
```

Single textarea, AI-suggest only (no preset). Same prose-result UX.

### Initial lore — list with inline editor

```
─── Initial lore ─────────  [✨ Suggest lore]  [+ Add lore]

┌─ Magic systems ─────────────────────────────────┐  ✕
│ Magic flows from sealed wells across the realm…│
│ category: cosmology · keyword_llm              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ The Old Empire ────────────────────────────────┐  ✕
│ A thousand years ago, the Empire ruled most of…│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Per-row compact view: title + truncated body + non-default chips.
Click expands to inline editor:

```
Title           [_____________________________]
Body            [textarea, multi-paragraph]
Category        [_____________________________]

▼ More options
  Tags           [chip input]
  Injection mode [keyword_llm ▾]
  Priority       [0]
```

Defaults sensible (`keyword_llm`, priority `0`, no tags / category).
80%+ skip the disclosure.

**Long scroll** — no pagination chrome on the lore list, per the
[lists pattern](../../patterns/lists.md). Virtualization library
is settled (`@tanstack/react-virtual` on web, FlatList on native);
if the lore list is long enough that render cost bites, drop in
the same engine Autocomplete uses.

### Validation gates on `Next`

- `genre.label`, `setting`: encouraged, **not** gated.
- Lore rows present must have `title` + `body` non-empty (per the
  [lore detail-pane decision](../../../explorations/2026-04-30-lore-detail-pane.md)).
  Empty rows surface inline errors.

## Step 4 — Cast

Step heading: **Who's in this story?**

Mixed list of entities (characters / locations / items / factions),
insertion-ordered, kind-iconed per
[`patterns/entity.md`](../../patterns/entity.md). Long scroll.

```
[lead-required notice if applicable]

                          [✨ Suggest cast]   [+ Add ▾]

[entity rows…]
```

### Add affordances

- **`✨ Suggest cast`** — AI-assist → list result (paginated,
  default 5 mixed across kinds). Guidance steers ("more
  characters", "fantasy nobility roles"). Cross-batch references
  (location's `parent_location_name`, character's faction)
  resolve at import time by name.
- **`+ Add ▾`** — dropdown of `Character / Location / Item /
Faction`. Click → blank row appended in expanded edit state.

### Compact row presentation

```
[👤] Aria Stoneheart  ⭐ lead                          ✕
A young blacksmith from a fallen kingdom…

[👤] Old Jorin                                          ✕
The grizzled barkeeper of the Iron Tankard…
                                       [⭐ Set as lead]

[📍] Mornstone Keep                                     ✕
The fortified seat of House Aerwyn…

[👤] Gandalf  STAGED                                    ✕
A wandering wizard, gray of cloak and white of beard…
```

- Kind icon + name + chips (`⭐ lead` / `STAGED` non-default).
- Truncated description.
- `⭐ Set as lead` button on character rows when no other
  character is the lead AND status is `active`.
- `STAGED` chip + muted row content for staged entities.
- `✕` deletes (no confirm — wizard-time, no entries depend yet).

Click row → expand to inline editor.

### Character editor

```
Name        [_________________________________]  [Active ▾]
Description [textarea — user-authoritative who]

Voice       [optional, e.g. "clipped, formal"]
Traits      [chip input — soft cap 8]
Drives      [chip input — soft cap 6]

▼ Visual
  Physique       [_____________________________]
  Face           [_____________________________]
  Hair           [_____________________________]
  Eyes           [_____________________________]
  Attire         [_____________________________]
  Distinguishing [chip input]

▼ More options
  Tags          [chip input]
  Faction       [pick from cast ▾]

⭐ Set as lead   (button outside disclosure, character-only,
                 visible when no other character is the lead
                 AND status='active')
```

Maps to [`CharacterState`](../../../data-model.md#characterstate-shape).

**Tier rationale:**

- **Always-visible identity** (`Voice` / `Traits` / `Drives`) —
  personality essentials, compact. Wizard-authored values seed
  `CharacterState` at first-write per the
  [authorship contract](../../../data-model.md#authorship-contract);
  classifier extracts incrementally at runtime.
- **`▼ Visual` disclosure** — six sub-fields would dwarf the editor
  expanded. Defaulted closed.
- **`▼ More options`** — tags + faction. Faction picker reads
  currently-authored factions in the wizard's cast list;
  `(no factions yet — add one with + Add)` empty state when none
  exist. `null` = unaffiliated.

**Not in wizard editor** (per the authorship contract,
classifier-managed per-turn): `current_location_id`,
`equipped_items`, `inventory`, `stackables`, `lastSeenAt`. All
dynamic, populated by classifier once narrative starts.

### Location editor

```
Name        [_________________________________]  [Active ▾]
Description [textarea]

▼ More options
  Tags             [chip input]
  Parent location  [pick from cast ▾]
  Condition        [_____________________________]
```

Maps to [`LocationState`](../../../data-model.md#locationstate-shape).
`parent_location_id` enables containment hierarchy at creation;
picker reads currently-authored locations only.

### Item editor

```
Name        [_________________________________]  [Active ▾]
Description [textarea]

▼ More options
  Tags         [chip input]
  Condition    [_____________________________]
```

Maps to [`ItemState`](../../../data-model.md#itemstate-shape).
`at_location_id` excluded — per-turn classifier-managed.

### Faction editor

```
Name        [_________________________________]  [Active ▾]
Description [textarea]
Agenda      [chip input — soft cap 4]

▼ More options
  Tags        [chip input]
  Standing    [_____________________________]
```

Maps to [`FactionState`](../../../data-model.md#factionstate-shape).
`agenda` is identity-shaped (always visible); `standing` is
dynamic-state (under More options).

### Status field — `active` / `staged`

Default `active`. User can flip to `staged` for entities-not-yet-
introduced — particularly useful for IP-based stories where the
cast roster is known but only some enter the opening scene.
`retired` not reachable at wizard time.

**Cascading behaviors:**

- **Lead requires `status='active'`.** A staged character can't
  be the protagonist. `⭐ Set as lead` button hidden on
  staged-character rows. Marking the current lead as staged
  auto-unmarks lead with a [toast](../../patterns/toast.md):
  `Lead unset — staged characters can't be lead.`
- **Lead-required gate tightens** — "at least one **active**
  character marked as lead." Staged characters don't satisfy.
- **Opening generation enum-list filters to active.** Wizard-assist's
  structured-output schema for opening generation passes only
  `status='active'` cast as the enum for `sceneEntities`. Staged
  characters can't appear in opening scene metadata.
- **Stage promotion is classifier-per-turn.** When prose introduces
  a staged entity (it appears in `metadata.sceneEntities` of a
  new entry), the classifier promotes status `staged` → `active`
  on the spot. Lore-mgmt at chapter close handles compaction
  (traits / drives consolidation), not lifecycle.

### AI-suggest — structured identity

`✨ Suggest cast` returns structured output per kind:

```ts
{
  entities: Array<
    | {
        kind: 'character'
        name
        description
        status?: 'active' | 'staged'
        voice?
        traits?
        drives?
        visual?: { physique?; face?; hair?; eyes?; attire?; distinguishing? }
      }
    | {
        kind: 'location'
        name
        description
        status?: 'active' | 'staged'
        parent_location_name?
        condition?
      }
    | { kind: 'item'; name; description; status?: 'active' | 'staged'; condition? }
    | { kind: 'faction'; name; description; status?: 'active' | 'staged'; agenda?; standing? }
  >
}
```

`status` defaults to `'active'` when omitted. Guidance can drive
staged outputs (`"6 characters; 2 introduced later"` → 4 active +
2 staged).

Cross-batch reference resolution: location's
`parent_location_name` resolves at import time to entity ids
(matching by name within the suggested batch + existing cast);
unresolved fall back to `null`.

### Lead-required gating

- **Trigger** (set in step 1): `mode='adventure'` OR
  `narration ∈ {first, second}`.
- **Inline notice** at top of step when triggered AND no active
  character marked lead. Copy varies by reason.
- **`Next →` validation** blocks until satisfied when required.
- **Cascading from back-jump.** If user revisits step 1 and
  changes mode/narration, step 4's pill demotes from `✓` to `○`
  if the new rule isn't satisfied.

### Validation gates on `Next` (Cast)

- Each row: `name` non-empty.
- Lead requirement satisfied iff applicable.
- Otherwise no blocks; cast can be empty for creative + third.

## Step 5 — Opening & finish

Step heading: **How does this story begin?**

Two halves on one scrolling step: opening prose authoring, then
identity inputs, then `Finish`.

### Opening surface — three states

#### Empty (initial)

```
Generate with ✨, or start typing below.
[textarea — empty]
```

#### AI-generated preview (after `✨` → guidance → Generate)

```
Suggested opening
[scrollable prose preview]

Scene metadata:
  Cast in scene: Aria Stoneheart
  Location: Mornstone Keep

[Discard] [Refine…] [Regenerate] [Use this]
```

The metadata block surfaces structured-output refs
(`sceneEntities`, `currentLocationId`) emitted by wizard-assist,
resolved to entity names. Read-only — generation owns the refs.
Constrained to **active** wizard-curated cast; prose can mention
unbacked or staged names freely.

#### Committed prose (after `Use this` OR after manual typing)

```
Opening                                            [✨]

[textarea, editable, contains the prose]

Scene metadata: Aria Stoneheart · Mornstone Keep
  (visible only if AI-generated; user-written = empty)
```

User edits prose freely after committing. Editing AI-generated
prose does **not** clear metadata refs — refs stay intact (user
might tweak prose without invalidating cast/location grounding).
For fresh metadata, user regenerates via `✨`.

`✨` button stays available in committed state — regenerate /
refine entry point. Click on existing committed prose →
confirm-on-replace if non-empty (consistent with genre/tone
replace pattern).

### AI-assist for opening — structured output

Wizard-assist emits:

```ts
{
  prose: string,
  sceneEntities: string[],          // subset of active cast entity ids
  currentLocationId: string | null, // one of the active location ids
  worldTime: 0                      // story start; always 0
}
```

Standard `Discard / Refine / Regenerate / Use this` actions.
Failure path: inline error in popover. On malformed structured
output, the implementation falls back to treating the prose as
user-written (empty `sceneEntities` / `currentLocationId`); turn-2
classifier picks up scene metadata from there. The data shape
(per [`data-model.md → Opening entry`](../../../data-model.md#opening-entry))
already accommodates both populated and empty metadata without
ceremony.

### Title + description — inlined below opening

```
─── Story name ───                                     [✨]
Title       [_________________________________]
Description [_________________________________]
```

Both have AI-suggest:

- **Title** — chips result. Wizard-assist generates 5–10 candidate
  titles. Click chip to fill. `Regenerate` for fresh batch.
- **Description** — prose result (short). 1–3 sentences synthesizing
  the story.

Both calls fire from this step → see EVERYTHING (mode/narration/
calendar/genre/tone/setting/lore/cast/opening). Resolves the
"title generation with no prior data" concern that drove placing
identity at the end.

### Memory cost — Matryoshka effective dim

Conditional disclosure section, collapsed by default. Visible only
when both:

- `app_settings.default_story_settings.embeddingBackend === 'provider'`
  (story will use provider embeddings, not local).
- The default-provider's selected embedding model has
  `capabilities.matryoshkaSupported === true`
  ([data-model · cachedModels capabilities](../../../data-model.md#diagram)).

Hidden otherwise — local-mode stories use the bundled small model
where truncation isn't worth the quality tail; non-Matryoshka
provider models don't expose the lever.

[footer]: Storage estimate assumes a 30-chapter story; scales linearly
         with story length.
```

**Suggested default by platform.** At wizard load, the platform
the user is creating on drives the pre-selected option:

- Mobile → smallest curated dim that's `≥ 512` (typical: 1024).
- Desktop → model native dim (no truncation suggested).

Aventuras is local-first; a story stays on the device where it was
created. The suggestion reflects that reality. The pre-selection
shows a `← suggested` annotation on the matching row; the user can
override either way.

**Curated ladder.** The radios listed mirror the
`capabilities.matryoshkaDims` array from the provider's model
metadata. Models without an explicit ladder fall back to a
sensible defaults set (`[512, 1024, 2048, native]` clamped to
native).

**Custom dim.** The `Custom…` option opens a number input
constrained to `1 ≤ N ≤ native_dim`. Footer caveat: "Custom dims
not on the model's curated ladder may exhibit quality cliffs."

**Cost preview math — storage only.** Storage is the only cost
axis the preview claims. Math is precise: `dim × 4 bytes` per row
× projected row count for a 30-chapter story, derived from
[scale assumptions](../../../memory/retrieval.md#scale-assumptions).

Retrieval latency is **deliberately not shown.** Per-query KNN
scales linearly in dim (per
[PoC findings](../../../memory/followups.md#v1-blocking)),
so a smaller dim is mathematically faster, but the absolute
ms vary with the user's device and we have PoC data for one
device only. At realistic story scales the latency difference
between dims is sub-second across all reasonable choices —
storage is the load-bearing axis for the user's decision.

**Lock semantics.** The chosen dim writes to
`stories.settings.effectiveDim` at Finish, locked thereafter
along with `embedding_model_id` and `retrievalMode`. Same
re-index ramp applies if the user later wants a different dim —
exposed via the
[Model swap UX](../../../memory/retrieval.md#model-swap-ux)
since dim changes have the same vector-space invalidation
properties as model changes.

### Validation gate on `Finish`

- Opening prose non-empty.
- `title` non-empty.
- Lead-character constraint satisfied (re-checked from step 4).
- `description` optional (library card has muted "(no description
  yet)" fallback).
- If the Memory-cost section is shown and the user picked
  `Custom…`, the custom-dim input must be a positive integer
  ≤ model native dim. Empty / out-of-range blocks Finish with an
  inline error on that input.

### What `Finish` does — atomic commit

One SQLite transaction, all or none:

1. Insert `stories` row with `status='active'`, `definition` JSON,
   `settings` JSON copied from
   `app_settings.default_story_settings`, identity columns.
2. Insert initial `branches` row.
3. Insert wizard-authored `entities` rows (initial cast). Per-row:
   `kind`, `name`, `description`, `status`, `state` JSON. **Each
   embedded-field write triggers an embed** per the
   [eager-sync-on-write contract](../../../memory/retrieval.md#compute-lifecycle)
   — entity `name + description` is the embedded composite. The
   embed runs inline in the same transaction; `entities_vec` rows
   land alongside the metadata.
4. Insert wizard-authored `lore` rows (initial world). Each
   triggers an embed of `title + body` into `lore_vec`, same path
   as entities.
5. Insert `story_entries[1]` with `kind='opening'`, prose,
   metadata. `metadata.model = <wizard-assist profile model>` if
   AI-generated; else `null`. Story entries themselves aren't
   embedded; the opening is exempt from the classifier pass per
   [`architecture.md → Classifier does NOT run on the opening entry`](../../../architecture.md#agent-orchestration).
6. **No deltas written.** Per
   [baseline doc decision 10](../../../explorations/2026-04-29-story-definition-baseline.md),
   wizard creation is delta-log-exempt.
7. Clear the auto-saved session.
8. Route to reader-composer with the story open.

If any step fails, transaction rolls back; user remains on step 5
with an inline error. The most likely failure mode is the embed
step (steps 3-4) when the embedder isn't available; that gets its
own surfacing below.

### Embedder-unavailable on Finish

When the user's selected embedder isn't ready at commit time
(local model not yet initialized, provider mode network down,
embedder removed without replacement), the embed steps fail and
the whole transaction rolls back. Surfaces as an inline error at
step 5:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠ Couldn't initialize the embedder                       │
│   Provider request timed out after 3 retries.            │
│                                                           │
│   [ Retry ] [ Open Memory settings ] [ Cancel ]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Action choices:

- **Retry** — re-attempts the atomic commit.
- **Open Memory settings** — navigates to App Settings · Memory.
  Wizard state stays auto-saved (per
  [Save / cancel / draft semantics](#save--cancel--draft-semantics));
  user returns to step 5 unchanged after fixing the embedder.
- **Cancel** — abandons the wizard entirely. Drafts cleared. Same
  shape as the existing Cancel affordance.

If the embedder failure is recoverable (network blip, mid-init),
the user just retries. If it's structural (embedder broken on this
device, no provider configured for embedding), the Settings route
is the resolution path. The wizard does not silently downgrade to
a non-embedding mode — story creation requires retrieval to be
configured, consistent with the
[Onboarding · Skip-from-Step-4 hard gate](../onboarding/onboarding.md#step-4--pick-an-embedder).

## AI-assist pattern

The unifying primitive across every wizard AI call site. Backed
by the [`wizard-assist` agent](../../../data-model.md#app-settings-storage).

### Trigger

Inline `✨` icon-button at the field's label/control area. Always
visible; opt-in. Coexists with manual entry.

### Guidance popover

```
✨ Suggest setting

Optional guidance
[_______________________]
e.g. "Norse-flavored, post-apocalypse"

   [Cancel]  [Generate]
```

Empty guidance allowed. Soft cap ~200 chars on the input.

### Loading

Popover swaps to spinner showing the wizard-assist profile's
active model name. Cancellable.

### Result presentation — three shapes

| Shape     | Where                                                | Preview UI                                                            | Actions                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prose** | genre body, tone body, setting, description, opening | Read-only preview pane                                                | `Discard / Refine… / Regenerate / Use this`              |
| **List**  | cast suggestions, lore suggestions                   | Per-row checkboxes on condensed cards; pagination via `Generate more` | `Discard / Regenerate / Generate more / Import selected` |
| **Chips** | title suggestions                                    | 5–10 clickable label chips                                            | Click to pick; `Regenerate`; `Discard`                   |

### Refine — prose-result only

Fourth action button on prose preview opens an iteration popover:

```
✨ Refine setting

How should this change?
[_______________________]
e.g. "make it darker"

   [Cancel]  [Refine]
```

Cumulative — user can refine multiple times. Each refine is its
own wizard-assist call with current preview + refinement
instructions. Refine doesn't apply to list or chips
(`Regenerate` suffices).

### Failure

Inline error in the popover: `Couldn't generate. <reason>.
[Try again] [Cancel]`. No silent failure.

### No provider configured

Click-time check; popover shows `AI is not configured.
[Set up in Settings] [Cancel]`. Doesn't block manual wizard
completion.

### Cost

Each generation, regenerate, and refine call costs tokens.
**No metering, no caps** — cost is on the user. UI doesn't
surface per-call cost.

### Pagination on list results

`Generate more` after import preserves already-imported rows;
case-insensitive name dedupe applies (collisions show
`(already exists)` muted; checkbox auto-disabled).

### Context-shaping

Each call's prompt context is built from **current wizard state at
call time**. Quality compounds as the wizard progresses; by step
5, calls see everything (mode/narration/calendar/genre/tone/
setting/lore/cast/opening).

## Trigger inventory

| Step     | Field                  | Trigger | Result shape               |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| Frame    | `mode`, `narration`    | —       | —                          |
| Calendar | picker, origin         | —       | —                          |
| World    | `genre` (label + body) | yes     | prose                      |
| World    | `tone` (label + body)  | yes     | prose                      |
| World    | `setting`              | yes     | prose                      |
| World    | lore rows              | yes     | list                       |
| Cast     | entity rows            | yes     | list                       |
| Cast     | `leadEntityId`         | —       | —                          |
| Opening  | opening prose          | yes     | prose (with metadata refs) |
| Opening  | `title`                | yes     | chips                      |
| Opening  | `description`          | yes     | prose (short)              |

## Edge cases

- **Empty session.** Wizard opens, user touches nothing,
  cancels — no session persists, no resume prompt fires next time.
- **Concurrent draft + session.** Mutually exclusive; user
  resolves via the [concurrent-state prompts](../story-list/story-list.md#unfinished-wizard-session-automatic-safety-net).
- **Mode/narration change via back-jump that adds the lead
  requirement.** Step 4's pill demotes; user walks forward to
  satisfy.
- **AI-assist call mid-flight on Cancel.** Call cancels; session
  preserves at last committed state.
- **Save-as-draft with no title.** Draft card renders
  `Untitled story` placeholder; rename when resumed.
- **Replace-on-existing on genre/tone.** Confirm modal fires when
  preset OR AI-suggest accept would overwrite non-empty content.
- **Lead unset cascade.** Multiple paths can unmark lead (kind
  change, status flip to staged, row deletion). Same
  [toast](../../patterns/toast.md) copy ("Lead unset — ...") on each.

## Mobile expression

Renders per the
[mobile foundations contracts](../../foundations/mobile/README.md).
Full-screen route on every tier per
[layout.md → Surface bindings](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#surface-bindings--existing-app-surfaces);
wizard chrome IS the action vocabulary, so the universal top-bar
(`Actions`, Settings gear, story breadcrumb) doesn't apply at any
tier. Tablet inherits desktop verbatim per
[navigation.md → Tablet](../../foundations/mobile/navigation.md#tablet-6401023-px);
phone-tier specifics below.

- **Top-bar grid.** `[← Cancel]` left, `New story · step N of 5`
  centered, empty right slot. Three-column grid stays at every
  width; padding and font compress on phone. The button text
  "← Cancel" stays explicit (vs icon-only `[←]`) so the user
  distinguishes "cancel wizard" from "go back one step."
- **Step indicator pills.** Five named pills (~510 px total)
  overflow at 390 px width. On phone the labels hide and the row
  **collapses to dots-only**, ~160 px total. The top-bar already
  carries textual step context (`step N of 5`), so the named
  labels are redundant on narrow viewports — the active dot among
  five gives "where am I" sense without taking horizontal space.
  Backward-jump still works via tap on a `done` dot.
- **Step body padding.** `32px 48px` desktop → `16px 16px` phone.
- **Calendar pickrow** (the `1fr 1fr` picker alongside always-
  visible summary panel) **stacks vertically** on phone — picker
  on top, summary panel below, both full-width.
- **Calendar origin-row** already `flex-wrap`; tier-derived inputs
  wrap to multiple rows on phone naturally.
- **Cast / lore inline editor.** `100px 1fr auto` grid keeps three
  columns — labels are short and the input column flexes. Disclosure
  (`▼ Visual`, `▼ More options`) keeps content compact by default.
- **Footer.** `[Save as draft] [← Back] [Next →]` stays horizontal
  on phone with reduced padding.
- **Footer hides while keyboard is open.** Same shape as the save-
  bar contract per
  [touch.md → Save bar on phone](../../foundations/mobile/touch.md#save-bar-on-phone)
  — bottom-edge button row competing with composer real estate
  hides on `keyboardDidShow`, reappears on `keyboardDidHide`. The
  auto-save session (per
  [Save / cancel / draft semantics](#save--cancel--draft-semantics))
  preserves state independently; navigate-away protection survives
  the hidden footer.
- **Keyboard avoidance.** `KeyboardAvoidingView` per
  [platform.md → Keyboard avoidance](../../foundations/mobile/platform.md#keyboard-avoidance)
  reflows step-body content above the keyboard while a textarea is
  focused.
- **AI-assist popover** (the `✨` guidance and result surfaces per
  [AI-assist pattern](#ai-assist-pattern)) becomes **Sheet (bottom,
  medium ~50–60 %)** on phone per
  [layout.md → Mapping](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#mapping--desktop-to-mobile).
  Guidance input, prose / list / chips result, action row all
  inside the sheet. Refine flow: result sheet dismisses, refine
  sheet replaces (Sheet over Sheet not allowed per
  [layout.md → Stacking](../../foundations/mobile/layout.md#stacking)).
- **Replace-confirm modal** stays Modal all tiers per the layout
  binding table.
- **Calendar swap warnings** stay Modal all tiers per
  [`patterns/calendar-picker.md`](../../patterns/calendar-picker.md)
  and the layout binding table.
- **Safe areas.** Top-bar honors `insets.top`; footer honors
  `insets.bottom` per
  [platform.md → Safe areas](../../foundations/mobile/platform.md#safe-areas).
- **OS back as Cancel.** Android `BackHandler` and iOS swipe-back
  both fire the wizard's `← Cancel` semantics (preserve session,
  return to story-list) per
  [platform.md → OS back integration](../../foundations/mobile/platform.md#os-back-integration).

## Data-model touchpoints

- Wizard's atomic transaction populates `stories`, `branches`,
  `entities`, `lore`, `story_entries[1]` per
  [data-model.md → World-state storage](../../../data-model.md#world-state-storage)
  - [Story settings shape](../../../data-model.md#story-settings-shape).
- `wizard-assist` agent in the
  [agent registry](../../../data-model.md#app-settings-storage),
  seeded by [onboarding](../onboarding/onboarding.md#what-gets-seeded-silently).
- `CalendarSystem.exampleStartValue` (mandatory; per
  [calendar-systems/spec.md](../../../calendar-systems/spec.md#calendar-definition))
  seeds the step-2 origin tuple.
