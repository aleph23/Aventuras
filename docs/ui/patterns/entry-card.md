# EntryCard pattern

The reader-composer narrative-row compound. Renders all five
entry kinds (`user`, `ai`, `opening`, `system`, `streaming`) as
full-width bubbles with kind-keyed styling, conditional reasoning
body, in-place edit, and a muted world-time footer.

Sister patterns:

- [`icon-actions.md`](./icon-actions.md) — the per-entry action
  cluster (top-right, opacity 0.55 → 1.0 on hover) follows this
  pattern.
- [`save-sessions.md`](./save-sessions.md) — host-level save bar
  for the in-place edit flow; EntryCard exposes
  `onCommitEdit / onCancelEdit` for the host to bind.
- [`forms.md → Textarea primitive`](./forms.md#textarea-primitive) —
  the in-place edit textarea.

Used by:

- [Reader composer](../screens/reader-composer/reader-composer.md#per-entry-actions) —
  the narrative loop. Sole consumer in v1.

## Compound API

```ts
type EntryCardProps = {
  kind: 'user' | 'ai' | 'opening' | 'system' | 'streaming'
  content: string
  worldTimeLabel?: string

  onEdit?: () => void
  onDelete?: () => void // not for opening (block-delete) or system/streaming

  // AI / opening:
  meta?: { tokens: { reply: number; reasoning?: number }; model?: string }
  reasoning?: string
  onRegen?: () => void // ai only
  onBranch?: () => void // ai, opening
  onFlipEra?: () => void // user, ai, opening — host hides when eras: null

  // Streaming-only:
  streamingPhase?: 'reasoning' | 'reply'

  // System-only:
  detail?: string
  onRetry?: () => void
  onDismiss?: () => void

  // Edit-restrictions (uniform with principles):
  disabled?: boolean
  disabledReason?: string

  // Edit mode (host-controlled):
  editing?: boolean
  onContentChange?: (next: string) => void
  onCommitEdit?: () => void
  onCancelEdit?: () => void

  className?: string
}
```

Two structural choices:

1. **Edit mode is controlled.** `editing` boolean plus
   controlled `content` value plus
   `onContentChange / onCommitEdit / onCancelEdit` callbacks.
   Host owns dirty-state machinery (delta-log writes); compound
   relays keystrokes and renders textarea-or-prose.
2. **`worldTimeLabel` is pre-formatted.** Calendar formatting
   lives in the host's render pass via the active calendar's
   renderer. EntryCard renders the string opaque — same
   contract the top-bar chip uses.

## Per-kind structure

| Slot                       | user                             | ai                                        | opening                                | system                                       | streaming                             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Top line                   | `You` badge                      | meta line (glyph, brain, tokens)          | meta line                              | `System` with warn glyph                     | meta line (brain pulses, trailing → ) |
| Reasoning body             | —                                | conditional (`reasoning` set, expanded)   | conditional                            | —                                            | live-streaming on `streamingPhase`    |
| Content                    | prose (or textarea if `editing`) | prose                                     | prose                                  | error description with inline action buttons | partial prose tokens                  |
| Action cluster (top-right) | edit, `[flip era]`, delete       | edit, regen, branch, `[flip era]`, delete | edit, branch, `[flip era]` (no delete) | — (uses inline buttons)                      | —                                     |
| World-time footer          | shown                            | shown                                     | shown                                  | hidden                                       | hidden                                |
| Bubble styling             | `bg-highlight border-line-soft`  | `bg-region border-line`                   | same as ai                             | warn-tinted                                  | ai styling plus dashed border         |

`opening` renders identically to `ai` for visual treatment; the
discriminator only affects available actions. See
[data-model.md → Opening entry](../../data-model.md#opening-entry)
for the underlying invariant.

## Reasoning expansion

**Data source:** `props.reasoning`, sourced from
`story_entries.metadata.reasoning?: string` (see
[data-model.md → Entry metadata shape](../../data-model.md#entry-metadata-shape)).
Brain icon renders only when `reasoning` is present, or when
`streamingPhase === 'reasoning'`.

**State:** internal `expanded: boolean`, default `false`. Click
brain toggles. No external override prop.

**Animation:**

- Web: `transition: max-height 200ms ease-out` with
  measured-height clamp.
- Native: reanimated worklet on a shared `expanded` value with
  `withTiming(expanded ? measured : 0, { duration: 200 })`.
- Reasoning body uses `display: none` when collapsed so it
  doesn't take layout space and doesn't measure.

**Scroll-anchor concern (parent's responsibility, not
EntryCard's).** The reasoning body sits above content; expanding
above the viewport top would shift the user's view. EntryCard's
contract: emit a measurable, deterministic layout transition;
never pin its own height; let the parent's `measureElement`
(web) or `maintainVisibleContentPosition` (native) track the
shift. The
[reader narrative scroll-anchoring](../../followups.md#reader-narrative-scroll-anchoring-on-prepend)
followup covers the parent's mechanic.

## Edit mode

When `editing === true`:

- Content slot renders [`<Textarea>`](./forms.md#textarea-primitive)
  instead of prose `<Text>`.
- Textarea seeded with current `content`.
- `onContentChange(next)` fires on each keystroke.
- `<SaveBar>` is NOT rendered inside EntryCard. Host wires the
  existing [save-session pattern](./save-sessions.md) at
  detail-pane level; EntryCard exposes
  `onCommitEdit / onCancelEdit` for the host to bind.
- Brain, reasoning body, and action cluster are hidden during
  edit. The entry is in edit-mode focus.
- Reasoning text is NOT editable. Only `content`. Reasoning is
  generation provenance.

**Cross-tier:** identical on phone and desktop. Textarea spans
full content width. Mobile keyboard pushes the textarea up via
existing form-row patterns. No sheet, no modal — keeps the edit
in narrative flow.

## World-time footer

- Muted small text, bottom-right of bubble (`text-fg-muted text-xs`).
- Renders `props.worldTimeLabel` opaque.
- Hidden for `kind` ∈ { `system`, `streaming` } — system is
  generation-meta, streaming has no committed worldTime yet.
- Hidden when `worldTimeLabel` undefined (host's choice — e.g.,
  formatter failure or calendar omits this entry).

**Future hook:** the
[manual worldTime correction](../../followups.md#manual-worldtime-correction--cascade-vs-jump--downstream-blast-radius)
followup will turn this footer into a click-to-edit affordance.
Today: read-only display.

## Action cluster

Per-kind action sets:

| Kind      | edit                                                  | regen | branch | flip-era    | delete            |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| user      | yes                                                   | —     | —      | conditional | yes               |
| ai        | yes                                                   | yes   | yes    | conditional | yes               |
| opening   | yes                                                   | —     | yes    | conditional | no (block-delete) |
| system    | (inline buttons inside content; no top-right cluster) |
| streaming | (no actions; cancel via composer)                     |

`flip-era` is conditional: host passes `onFlipEra` only when
active calendar has eras. Same gating as the
[per-screen doc](../screens/reader-composer/reader-composer.md#per-entry-actions).

Position: absolute top-right of bubble; opacity 0.55 default,
1.0 on hover or focus per the
[icon-actions pattern](./icon-actions.md). Cluster gap and
density-aware sizing inherit from icon-actions.

## Variable-height plus virtualization compatibility

EntryCard's contract for parent virtualized lists:

- **No fixed height.** Bubble height is content-driven.
- **No key shenanigans.** Same key across re-renders (host
  passes `entry.id`).
- **Deterministic layout transitions.** Reasoning expand/collapse
  uses height-auto with predictable timing; parent's
  `measureElement` (web) or `FlatList`'s native layout (mobile)
  reacts naturally.
- **No layout effects fighting the parent.** EntryCard doesn't
  measure itself or apply scroll fixes.

The reader narrative scroll-anchoring concern is the parent
list's responsibility, not EntryCard's. EntryCard ships
compatible.

## Storybook (EntryCard)

Live demos for: user kind, ai kind (with reasoning expanded /
collapsed), opening kind (no delete action), system kind (with
detail expanded), streaming kind (reasoning-phase, reply-phase),
edit mode (textarea), disabled state, world-time footer
shown/hidden by kind. Belongs in
`Patterns/Reader composer/EntryCard` when component
implementation begins.

## What this design defers

- **Manual worldTime correction UI** — footer is the future
  home; today read-only.
- **Reasoning text in search scope** — provenance, not narrative
  content; lean: don't include. Revisit on demand.
- **Reasoning text in export / backup** — yes by default;
  confirms with the export-shape pass when it lands.
- **Click-to-edit on the world-time footer** — same future as
  manual worldTime correction.
