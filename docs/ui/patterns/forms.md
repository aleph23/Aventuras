# Form-control patterns

Input primitives reused across settings, entity forms, and any
"pick a value" interaction. Sister patterns to
[`entity.md`](./entity.md) (entity detail-pane composition rules
that consume these), [`lists.md`](./lists.md), and
[`data.md`](./data.md).

Used by:

- [App Settings](../screens/app-settings/app-settings.md)
  (Select primitive across providers / profiles / story defaults;
  Input primitive for the API-key field with trailing show/hide
  eye)
- [Story Settings](../screens/story-settings/story-settings.md#generation-tab--definitional-fields--authoring-aids)
  (Select primitive across mode / narration / generation knobs;
  Autocomplete-with-create on the model field; Input + Textarea
  for prose definition fields; SwitchRow pattern for per-story
  toggles; TagInput pattern on the story tags field)
- [Plot](../screens/plot/plot.md#mobile-expression)
  (Select primitive on the Threads / Happenings segment toggle and
  as the detail-pane tab navigation on phone; SwitchRow for the
  common-knowledge skip toggle; TagInput pattern on thread +
  happening tags fields)
- [Wizard](../screens/wizard/wizard.md#step-1--frame)
  (Select primitive in segment mode for mode / narration; calendar
  picker integration cite; Input + Textarea for genre / tone /
  setting fields, narrow numeric for year / day fields)
- [Reader composer](../screens/reader-composer/reader-composer.md#per-entry-actions)
  (Autocomplete-with-create primitive in entity / lore creation;
  Input + Textarea for entity / lore detail fields; TagInput
  pattern on entity / lore tags during creation)
- [Onboarding](../screens/onboarding/onboarding.md)
  (Select primitive in initial setup flow)
- [Vault calendars](../screens/vault/calendars/calendars.md)
  (Select primitive in the calendar editor; narrow numeric Inputs
  for era year / day fields)
- [World](../screens/world/world.md#mobile-expression)
  (Select primitive on the list-pane category dropdown and as the
  detail-pane tab navigation when the desktop tab strip overflows
  on narrow tiers; Input + Textarea for entity edits; TagInput
  pattern on entity + lore tags fields)

## Form rows — stacked-on-narrow-container

Cross-cutting layout rule for the row wrapper that hosts a
label / hint / input triple in any of the surfaces above.
Independent of which input primitive sits inside.

### Container-keyed layout

A form row renders as:

- **Two-column grid** (label-left, input-right) when its **form
  container** is `≥ 640 px` wide. Existing desktop preferences-pane
  aesthetic — uppercase 11 px monospace label, 180 px label column
  on desktop, 120 px on the tablet-narrow band (`640 px ≤ container
< 1024 px`).
- **Stacked single-column block** (label-above, input-below) when
  the form container is `< 640 px` wide. Applies regardless of
  viewport tier.

The rule keys on the **form wrapper's** width, not on the viewport
tier. This separates two concerns:

- Viewport size drives the master-detail split (list ↔ detail as
  separate phone screens vs. side-by-side rail+content on
  tablet+desktop) — pinned by
  [`mobile/collapse.md → Two-pane navigation surfaces`](../foundations/mobile/collapse.md#two-pane-navigation-surfaces-world-plot-settings).
- Container size drives the form-row layout inside whichever
  detail surface the user is looking at.

Effect across tiers:

| Tier             | Detail container width     | Form-row layout |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Phone            | ~360-430 px (full-bleed)   | stacked         |
| Tablet portrait  | ~544-620 px (rail visible) | stacked         |
| Tablet landscape | ~820 px                    | 2-col           |
| Desktop          | ~920 px (form max-width)   | 2-col           |

Tablet portrait detail panes are mobile-narrow once the rail
takes its 200 px share — the container rule picks the right shape
automatically. A user resizing a desktop window narrow, or
splitting the screen vertically, also gets stacked rows when the
form container drops below the threshold.

### Stacked-row visual treatment

When stacked:

- **Label** — sits on its own line above the input. Sentence-case,
  `--font-ui` system sans, 14 px / `text-sm`, `font-medium`,
  `--fg-primary`. Drops the uppercase / monospace / letter-spacing
  chrome the desktop pane carries.
- **Hint** — sits beneath the label, above the input. Sentence-case
  sans, 12 px / `text-xs`, `--fg-secondary`. No monospace.
- **Input** — consumes the full content width of the form
  container. Control height inherits from the active density
  (regular default on phone = 44 px, meeting Apple's tap-target
  floor; see also
  [`mobile/touch.md → Touch-target floor on phone`](../foundations/mobile/touch.md#touch-target-floor-on-phone)).
- **Spacing** — ~6 px between label and input, ~16 px between
  rows.

When 2-col (`≥ 640 px` container), the existing desktop aesthetic
is preserved unchanged.

### Input width within form rows

Form-row inputs — Input, Textarea, Select trigger (dropdown
mode), Select segment — span the full content width of their
form column / row by default at every tier. No primitive-level
width cap. Stacked containers see inputs at full row width;
2-col containers see inputs at full input-column width
(form-row's `1fr` column). Segment Selects stretch
(`justify-self: stretch`) inside the row rather than hugging
content (`justify-self: start`) — the desktop "hug" idiom is the
exception, not the default.

**Per-field narrowing is opt-in for desktop visual balance only,
and DOES NOT carry to narrow containers.** Wizard year / day
inputs cap their width on desktop because the surrounding form
expects compact compositions; a similar narrow cap on chapter-
token-threshold or recent-buffer numeric inputs in settings is
sometimes tempting on desktop but should NOT propagate down. On
narrow containers, full-width is preferred over per-field caps —
consistency with the form's vertical rhythm beats per-field
horizontal optimization. Implementation: don't pin per-field
widths via inline `style="max-width: ..."` (which beats
`@container` overrides via CSS specificity); use a class the
narrow-container rule can override, or accept full-width on
every tier as the simpler choice.

This rule unifies world / plot / story-settings / app-settings /
vault-calendar form rendering. Earlier wireframes inconsistently
applied `max-width: 380px` (and 260 / 280 / 320) caps on Select
triggers and select-style numeric inputs for desktop visual
balance — those caps drop; inputs fill their column. Settings
numerics like `chapter token threshold`, `protected buffer`, and
`partial chapter buffer` are full-width on every tier; the user types a 3-5 char value into a
field that's the same width as its label-row neighbors.

### Inline-row exceptions

Rows that stay inline regardless of container width (the row's
own primitive owns the layout):

- **[`SwitchRow`](#switchrow-pattern)** — label + optional hint
  on the left, switch on the right. Whole row tappable. Already
  mobile-native by design.
- **Slider row** — `[—————O—————] [42]`. Slider track + numeric
  input stay inline with each other. The label above them follows
  the stacked rule on narrow containers.
- **Segment selector row** — segment is the input. Label above on
  narrow containers, segment below as a single inline strip.
- **Select (radio mode)** — option list is already a vertically
  stacked tappable card list. Label above the list on narrow
  containers; the list's option rows render label and description
  **stacked vertically** next to the radio dot at every tier (not
  side-by-side).
- **Select (dropdown / segment mode)** — trigger is one line;
  composes naturally with the stacked rule.

### Tighter accordion-body label scope

Group D pinned a 90 px label-column override scoped to
`.profile-body .field-row` and `.narrative-card .field-row` for
the densest provider / profile / narrative editors (per
[`2026-05-02-mobile-group-d-settings.md`](../../explorations/2026-05-02-mobile-group-d-settings.md)).
With the container rule, this override only meaningfully applies on
**wide containers** (`640 px ≤ container < 1024 px`); on narrow
containers the stacked rule subsumes the column entirely. Net: 90
px override active on tablet landscape and desktop accordion-body
editors only.

### Implementation note

- **Web.** CSS Container Queries (Baseline since 2023) match the
  rule directly: declare the form wrapper as `container-type:
inline-size`, write `@container (max-width: 639px)` to apply the
  stacked variant. NativeWind 4 supports container queries on web.
- **Native.** No native container-query primitive in RN. Two
  options:
  - **Width-measurement hook.** A `useFormWidth()` hook reading
    `onLayout` of the form wrapper and toggling a stacked class.
    First-paint flicker possible on initial mount.
  - **Tier-driven approximation.** Toggle stacked when
    `useTier() === 'phone' || (useTier() === 'tablet' &&
railVisible)`. Misses the rare "narrow desktop window" case but
    has no measurement cost. Acceptable starting point for v1
    surfaces.

Pick per-consumer; the contract is the visual rule, not the
mechanism.

## Select primitive

One primitive, three render modes. Component used everywhere a
"pick one of N values to commit" interaction surfaces in the app.

### Render modes

- **`segment`** — horizontal bordered button group. Best for ≤3
  options, label-only.
- **`dropdown`** — collapsed picker. Best for ≥4 options, or any
  cardinality where horizontal space is scarce (chrome carve-out
  below).
- **`radio`** — vertical list with explanatory copy per option.
  Triggered by content shape, not cardinality — when each option
  carries a `description` the segment/dropdown can't surface.

### Auto-derivation cascade

```
1. Explicit `mode` prop → use as-is.
2. Any option has a description field → radio.
3. Else if option count ≤ 3 (≤ 2 on mobile) → segment.
4. Else → dropdown.
```

Trigger for radio is **content shape**; trigger for segment vs
dropdown is **cardinality**. Independent axes.

**Cardinality threshold of 3** is the default for desktop; **bumps
to 2 on mobile** where horizontal real estate is tighter. Pinned
in [`mobile/foundations` Group C](../../explorations/2026-05-01-mobile-group-c-master-detail.md#tab-strip-overflow-rule)
alongside the tab-strip overflow rule.

**Phone-tier dropdown surface.** When the cascade picks `dropdown`
on phone, the trigger renders inline (chip / pill / select-shaped
button) and **opens via Sheet** — bottom sheets are the native
mobile pattern for value-pick from a list; web-style anchored
popovers are absent from native mobile UIs. Native-idiom rationale
in [`docs/explorations/2026-05-03-select-primitive.md → Why Sheet on phone, not Popover`](../../explorations/2026-05-03-select-primitive.md#why-sheet-on-phone-not-popover).

Sheet size auto-derives from option shape:

- **Sheet (short)** for flat lists of short labels (≤ ~6 options,
  no `group` field, no `description`). Default for the dropdown
  branch on phone.
- **Sheet (medium)** for grouped lists or option counts where short
  feels cramped (~7+ options, or any options carrying a `group`
  field). Auto-applied; `sheetSize` prop overrides. The
  [calendar picker pattern](./calendar-picker.md) is the canonical
  Sheet (medium) consumer — its richer rows and tail action go
  beyond Select's contract via the `renderRow` / `renderTrigger` /
  `tailAction` extension points, resolved during the calendar
  picker build pass.

Tablet keeps the desktop anchored Popover — no edge-clipping risk
at tablet widths. Segment and radio render modes are unchanged at
every tier (segment is inline; radio is vertical list).

If a list outgrows Sheet (medium) — typeahead-shaped or genuinely
long (200+ rows like provider model lists) — the right primitive
is **Autocomplete**, not a richer Select. Same per-tier
idiomatic mapping applies to Autocomplete: anchored popover on
desktop, Sheet (tall) with input pinned at top + suggestions list
below on phone (see
[Autocomplete-with-create primitive](#autocomplete-with-create-primitive)).

The underlying Sheet and Popover primitive contracts (API surface,
rn-primitives mapping, slot reshape) live in
[`overlays.md`](./overlays.md). The phone-tier Sheet bridge is
implemented in-Select via `useTier()`. The shared per-tier dispatch
for the overlay consumers that build on our Popover primitive
(Autocomplete, provider-model-picker, Actions menu) lives in
[`SearchableOverlayList`](./searchable-overlay-list.md); Select
cannot share it — Select's popover branch uses
`@rn-primitives/select`'s own machinery, not our Popover. See
[Implementation contract](#select--implementation-contract).

### Chrome carve-out

The cardinality rule applies in the **content area** — list panes,
detail panes, settings tabs, dialogs, drawers, form fields.

**In chrome** — top bars, sub-headers, toolbars, breadcrumbs —
**dropdown is allowed regardless of cardinality**, because
horizontal space is genuinely scarce.

The boundary is concrete: top of screen vs body. Story-list's sort
dropdown sits in the toolbar above the grid (chrome → dropdown OK
even at 3 options). Plot's segment toggle sits in the list-pane
controls (body → cardinality rule applies).

For genuinely ambiguous cases, **default to the primary cardinality
rule**; the carve-out is for clear chrome cases (top-bar, breadcrumb-
line dropdowns), not "anywhere wide-ish."

### Trigger sizes

The Trigger button exposes three height variants:

- `xs` → `h-control-xs` (36 px at regular density). Chrome-row use —
  `Toolbar.Sort` is the canonical exemplar per the
  [Toolbar height contract](./toolbar.md#height-contract--primary-input-vs-secondary-chrome-cluster).
- `sm` → `h-control-sm` (40 px at regular).
- `md` → `h-control-md` (44 px at regular). Default; form-row use.

`size` is exposed on the public `<Select>` props. Default `md`,
unchanged from prior behavior. The dropdown content surface (anchored
popover on tablet/desktop, Sheet on phone) is unaffected by Trigger
size — Sheet sizing derives from option count per the
[cardinality cascade](#auto-derivation-cascade).

`lg` is intentionally absent — Select-as-hero-CTA isn't a v1 shape;
buttons cover that role. See the
[primitive height inventory](../foundations/spacing.md#primitive-height-inventory)
for the cross-primitive size landscape.

### What stays separate

- **Autocomplete-with-create primitive** — its own pattern, see
  [below](#autocomplete-with-create-primitive). Same conceptual
  family as Select but different surface area: typeahead against a
  list with a tail-create affordance.
- **Filter chips** — own primitive (rounded, wrap-capable layout,
  often paired with `All` accordion behavior). Filtering-centric
  concern, not "pick a value to commit." Folding into Select as a
  `chips` render mode is a possible future move; deferred until
  enough chip-using surfaces converge.
- **Preset+custom hybrid** — pattern used by chapter token
  threshold on
  [Story Settings → Memory](../screens/story-settings/story-settings.md#mobile-expression)
  and
  [App Settings → Memory](../screens/app-settings/app-settings.md#mobile-expression):
  three preset chips plus a `Custom…` chip that reveals a
  numeric input below. Doesn't fit Select's three render modes
  cleanly (cardinality 4 would route to dropdown, but the user
  needs to compare presets at a glance). Implemented as
  `.chip-row` with `.add-chip` cells — wraps naturally at narrow
  tiers. Not yet abstracted into its own primitive; if more
  preset+custom hybrids surface (e.g., protected buffer size,
  timeout windows), promote it to a named pattern.

### Storybook (Select)

Live demos of each render mode + the auto-derivation rule belong in
a `Patterns/Form controls/Select primitive` MDX page when component
implementation begins. The page cites this principle as canonical
and embeds component stories — no prose duplication.

### Select — implementation contract

Phase 2 Group B locked the implementation shape per
[`docs/explorations/2026-05-03-select-primitive.md`](../../explorations/2026-05-03-select-primitive.md).
Highlights:

- **Two-layer architecture.** Public exports are `<Select>`
  (options-driven dispatcher resolving the cascade above) and
  `SelectPrimitive.*` namespace (reshaped reusables baseline, used
  by power consumers — calendar picker, future rich-row pickers).
- **Baseline source.** `react-native-reusables` Select scaffold
  reshaped over [`@rn-primitives/select`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rn-primitives/select)
  per [`components.md` reshape rules](../components.md#sourcing--react-native-reusables-as-baseline).
- **Phone-tier Sheet bridge.** `SelectPrimitive.Content` dispatches
  on `useTier()`: phone renders sheet-style chrome (bottom-anchored
  panel with drag handle visual, scrim, slide-in animation) inside
  `SelectBase.Portal` + `SelectBase.Overlay`, with
  `SelectBase.Content disablePositioningStyle` overriding the
  baseline anchor-positioning math. The phone branch can't reuse
  our `<Sheet>` primitive directly because Sheet's portal bridges
  Dialog's RootContext, not Select's; items inside would throw
  "compound components rendered outside the Select component".
  Tablet / desktop renders the rn-primitives select Portal /
  Overlay / Content (anchored popover, reusables baseline).
  Phone Sheet dismisses via tap-outside (Overlay), back-press,
  and drag-down — the gesture pattern is duplicated locally
  rather than shared with Sheet because the unmount-safety
  property each pattern relies on (fresh dragOffset per open) is
  satisfied independently by each primitive's portal returning
  null on close. A future Sheet refactor could extract the
  gesture+animation pattern into a shared portal-less shell.
- **Native scroll wrap.** Reusables baseline ships scroll-free on
  native (Viewport is a Fragment); reshape wraps it in
  `<ScrollView>` with viewport-fraction max-height. Web inherits
  baseline `max-h-52` + ScrollUpButton / ScrollDownButton.
- **Virtualization** lives inside Autocomplete via
  `@tanstack/react-virtual` (web) + `FlatList` (native phone
  Sheet). The dropdown stays virtualized regardless of source-list
  size.
- **Keyboard handling on phone.** The phone Sheet inherits the
  Sheet primitive's default `avoidKeyboard={true}` for the
  outer layout response — no consumer change needed. Select
  variants that host a search input wrap their option list in
  `KeyboardAwareScrollView` (from
  `react-native-keyboard-controller`) per
  [`overlays.md → Sheet — Keyboard handling`](./overlays.md#sheet--keyboard-handling),
  so the focused search input scrolls into view above the
  keyboard. The Sheet's body-drag dismiss is automatically
  suspended while the keyboard is shown; the drag handle
  remains active.

---

## Input primitive

Single-line text input. The thinnest of the form primitives;
consumers compose label and helper text externally per the
project's compose-don't-encapsulate principle.

### Input — variants

- **`size`** — `sm`, `md` (default), `lg`. Resolves to the same
  `h-control-{sm|md|lg}` density tokens as Button.
- **`leading`** — adornment slot before the text. Typical content:
  a non-interactive `<Icon>` (search magnifying-glass, lock).
- **`trailing`** — adornment slot after the text. Typical content:
  an interactive press target (password show/hide eye,
  search-syntax info popover trigger, clear-x).

There is no `narrow` size for numeric fields. Width is a layout
decision — consumers pass `className="w-24"` (or similar) for
year / day-number inputs. Conflating height (density) with width
(layout) into a single variant would couple two independent
axes.

### Error state via `aria-invalid`

The primitive doesn't expose a `state` prop. Error styling fires
off `aria-invalid={true}` on the input — consumers drive validity
through ARIA the same way form libraries surface it. Border swaps
to `--danger`, focus ring swaps to `--danger/20`. The same pattern
applies to Textarea below.

### Adornment layout

When neither slot is set the primitive renders as a bare
`TextInput` (single-node tree, no wrapper). When either slot is
set, the primitive wraps the `TextInput` in a row View; the
border + focus ring move to the wrapper. On web,
`focus-within:border-accent` fires when the inner input is
focused; on native, an `onFocus`/`onBlur` state pair on the
wrapper drives the same class. Consumer concerns:

- **Trailing buttons own their own press affordance.** The slot
  wrapping View has padding only; interactive children
  (`Pressable`, `Button`) handle their own hit area and press
  state.
- **Trailing tap doesn't blur the input.** RN's TextInput keeps
  focus through sibling presses by default — password-eye toggles
  don't need `blurOnSubmit`-style workarounds.

### Input — implementation contract

Phase 2 Group C locked the implementation shape per
[`docs/explorations/2026-05-03-input-textarea-primitives.md`](../../explorations/2026-05-03-input-textarea-primitives.md).
Highlights:

- **Baseline source.** `react-native-reusables` Input scaffold
  reshaped over RN's `TextInput` per
  [`components.md` reshape rules](../components.md#sourcing--react-native-reusables-as-baseline).
- **NativeWind 4 variant bridges.** `placeholder:` resolves to
  `placeholderTextColor` on RN; `aria-invalid:` honors the ARIA
  attribute on both platforms.
- **Selection color** uses `--accent` / `--accent-fg` (web only —
  RN doesn't surface text-selection colors).

---

## Textarea primitive

Multi-line text input. Same upstream primitive as Input
(`TextInput` with `multiline`), but split for clarity and to keep
multiline-specific props off the single-line surface.

### Textarea — variants

- **`rows`** — initial / minimum visible line count. Default `3`.
- **`maxRows`** — line count past which the textarea scrolls
  internally. Default `10`.
- **`aria-invalid`** — same error contract as Input.

There is no `size` prop; Textarea height is content-driven via
`rows` and `maxRows`. There are no adornment slots; multiline
content doesn't compose visually with leading / trailing icons,
and no v1 wireframe needs it.

### Auto-grow across platforms

- **Web** — `field-sizing: content` (modern CSS) handles
  content-driven height with no JS. The `min-h` / `max-h` envelope
  bounds it.
- **Native** — `onContentSizeChange` updates a measured-height
  state, applied as inline `height` clamped to the
  `[minHeight, maxHeight]` envelope derived from
  `rows × line-height + padding × 2` and
  `maxRows × line-height + padding × 2` respectively. Padding
  reads from the active density's `--row-py-md` token; line-height
  is fixed at NativeWind's `text-sm` default (20px).

User-driven vertical resize (drag the corner) is web-only via
`resize-y`. Native has no resize handle.

### Textarea — implementation contract

- **Baseline source.** Same as Input — `react-native-reusables`
  scaffold reshaped over `TextInput`.
- **Pure envelope math** lives in
  `components/ui/textarea-envelope.ts` so the unit tests can
  import it without dragging in NativeWind / RN / density-context.
  Vitest's unit project has no `@/` alias; keeping the math
  dependency-free is the cheapest path to test isolation.

---

## SwitchRow pattern

The canonical cross-platform shape for boolean settings. Label +
optional hint on the left, Switch indicator on the right; the
**whole row is the tap target** on every tier. v1 wireframe
consumers (Story Settings, App Settings, Plot) all use this shape.

**Two anti-patterns this replaces** in older wireframes — both
swept during the
[mobile settings revisit](../../explorations/2026-05-04-mobile-settings-revisit.md):

- **Standalone Switch + adjacent label inside a 2-col field-row.**
  The label sat in `.field-label`, the switch sat in the
  `.toggle-row` input slot. Reading left-to-right made the label
  feel like form-field chrome; the tap target was switch-only, not
  row. SwitchRow lifts the label out of the field-row, makes the
  whole row tappable.
- **Segment Select with `[off | on]` for boolean settings.**
  Segment is for cardinality ≥ 2 with semantically meaningful
  options; using it for boolean on/off makes the user pick between
  two values when one toggle suffices. SwitchRow is the right
  primitive for boolean. Multi-state tri-state cases
  (`[auto | force on | force off]`) and semantic two-option picks
  (`[first-person | third-person]`) stay segment.

Modern desktop OSes have converged on row-tappable toggles:
macOS Ventura+ System Settings, Windows 11 Settings, GNOME
Settings, and most modern web design systems (Notion, Linear,
1Password) all click anywhere on the row. Standalone-switch-with-
adjacent-label is the old-school NSSwitch shape, no longer
canonical. SwitchRow ships once and renders the same on every
platform.

### SwitchRow — visual contract

- **Layout.** Pressable row with `flex-row items-center gap-3`,
  density-driven row padding (`px-row-x-md py-row-y-md`), and
  `rounded-md`. Label + hint on the left in a flex-1 column;
  Switch indicator on the right.
- **Label.** Standard `<Text>` with `font-medium`.
- **Hint.** Optional second `<Text variant="muted" size="sm">`
  below the label.
- **Press feedback.** `active:bg-bg-raised` on every tier;
  `hover:bg-bg-raised` adds a desktop hover affordance.
- **Disabled.** `opacity-50` on the entire row; row presses are
  blocked.

### SwitchRow — implementation contract

- **Tap-target plumbing.** Outer Pressable owns the touch +
  a11y (`role="switch"`, `accessibilityState={{checked, disabled}}`).
  Inner Switch is wrapped in a View with `pointerEvents="none"` so
  taps fall through to the row Pressable rather than firing the
  inner Switch's own onCheckedChange. Required `onCheckedChange`
  on the inner Switch takes a no-op handler — the inner Switch
  is purely a visual indicator in this pattern.
- **API.** `{ label, hint?, checked, onCheckedChange, disabled?,
className? }`. No size prop — Switch dimensions follow density
  through the inner Switch primitive.

---

## Switch primitive

Boolean toggle building block. Used directly in cases that don't
fit the SwitchRow pattern (toolbar quick-toggles, inline status
indicators) — but **none of those exist in v1 wireframes**, so
Switch standalone is essentially infrastructure for SwitchRow
plus future use.

Track + thumb dimensions bind to the active density — phone
(default regular density) gets touch-friendly sizes; desktop
(default compact) stays mouse-tight.

### Switch — visual contract

| Density     | Track                        | Thumb         | On-state translate     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| compact     | `h-[1.15rem] w-8` (~18 × 32) | `size-4` (16) | `translate-x-3.5` (14) |
| regular     | h-6 w-11 (24 × 44)           | size-5 (20)   | translate-x-5 (20)     |
| comfortable | h-7 w-12 (28 × 48)           | size-6 (24)   | translate-x-5 (20)     |

- **Track.** `bg-fg-muted` when off; `bg-accent` when on.
  Always rounded-full; `border border-transparent` reserves
  layout space for the focus ring without shifting the layout.
- **Thumb.** Always `bg-bg-base` (provides contrast on both track
  states across light + dark themes). Translates from
  `translate-x-0` (off) to the per-density on-state value above.
- **Disabled.** `opacity-50` on the entire control.
- **Web focus ring.** Standard `focus-visible:border-accent
focus-visible:ring-focus-ring/50`.

### Switch — implementation contract

- **Baseline source.** `react-native-reusables` Switch scaffold
  reshaped over `@rn-primitives/switch` (Root + Thumb).
- **Required props.** `checked`, `onCheckedChange`. Storybook
  static states pass a no-op handler.
- **Density binding** happens in-component via `useDensity()`;
  no external prop. Consumers see one `<Switch>` API; the visual
  scales with the user's chosen density.

---

## Checkbox primitive

Boolean affordance distinct from Switch — for multi-select lists
and "I agree" gating shapes that don't fit a SwitchRow.

> **Speculative — no v1 wireframe consumer.** Checkbox shipped
> ahead of demand to round out the choice-primitive set. If a real
> consumer doesn't surface during phase 3 implementation, candidate
> for park-or-drop.

Box dimensions bind to active density; same rationale as Switch.

### Checkbox — visual contract

| Density     | Box         | Check icon |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| compact     | size-4 (16) | 12         |
| regular     | size-5 (20) | 14         |
| comfortable | size-6 (24) | 16         |

- **Box.** Density-driven square with `rounded-[4px]`,
  `border border-border bg-bg-base`. Border swaps to
  `border-accent` when checked, `border-danger` when invalid.
- **Indicator.** Filled `bg-accent` rectangle inside, with a
  `Check` icon in `text-accent-fg`. Indicator is rendered only
  when checked.
- **Hit slop.** `hitSlop={24}` retained from the baseline —
  still useful for the compact density on phone.
- **Disabled.** `opacity-50`.
- **Web focus ring.** Standard `focus-visible:border-accent
focus-visible:ring-focus-ring/50`.

### Checkbox — implementation contract

- **Baseline source.** `react-native-reusables` Checkbox scaffold
  reshaped over `@rn-primitives/checkbox` (Root + Indicator).
- **Error styling driven from JS** via `aria-invalid` prop reading
  rather than the CSS `aria-invalid:` Tailwind variant. Same
  reliability strategy as Input + Textarea — RN-Web doesn't
  always forward arbitrary aria-\* attributes from rn-primitives
  wrappers, so the CSS attribute selector silently misses.
- **Density binding** happens in-component via `useDensity()`;
  same single-API pattern as Switch.

## Autocomplete-with-create primitive

Single text input with a live filtered dropdown and a tail-create
option. Used wherever the user picks from a known list **OR**
contributes a new entry to the same field — narrative free-text
fields where canonical suggestions exist but coverage is open.

Composes [`SearchableOverlayList`](./searchable-overlay-list.md) in
`searchPlacement: 'as-trigger'` mode — the substrate provides the
per-tier overlay, the search input, virtualization, and keyboard
navigation. This primitive owns the source-list semantics, the
tail-create row, and the commit behavior below.

**First user**: era flip's `era_name` input. Likely future users:
tag pickers, entity-link pickers when an ad-hoc entity is
acceptable, entry-ref pickers.

### Anatomy

- **Text input** — always present, focused on open in modal
  contexts.
- **Dropdown surface.** Provided by
  [`SearchableOverlayList`](./searchable-overlay-list.md) — an
  anchored popover on desktop/tablet, a bottom Sheet on phone with
  the input pinned at the top. See its
  [Structure & ARIA](./searchable-overlay-list.md#structure--aria)
  for the per-tier shapes — Autocomplete is the substrate's Shape 1
  on desktop/tablet.
- **Dropdown content** — appears below the input on focus / typing.
  Two zones:
  - **Suggestions** (top) — entries from the source list filtered
    by the typed value (case-insensitive substring match by
    default; short lists don't need fuzzy matching). Up to ~7
    visible; scroll within the dropdown beyond that.
  - **`+ Add new: "<typed>"` row** (bottom) — appears only when
    the typed value doesn't exactly match any source entry
    (case-insensitive comparison). Visually distinct from
    suggestions (e.g., separator above + muted "+ Add new" label
    prefix).

### Source list semantics

- **Empty / absent source** — no suggestions; the dropdown shows
  only the `+ Add new` row when the user has typed something.
  Component degrades cleanly to a free-form input with consistent
  UI.
- **Casing normalization** — exact case-insensitive match against a
  source entry **commits in the source's canonical case**. Typing
  `"reiwa"` against `['Reiwa']` commits `Reiwa`. Preserves the
  intent of curated source lists; users don't have to nail casing
  to hit a known value.
- **Match on whitespace-trimmed value** — leading/trailing
  whitespace ignored for matching; commit value is also trimmed.

### Default Enter behavior

- **Has matching suggestions** → pick the first match (commit in
  canonical casing).
- **No matching suggestions** → treat as `+ Add new` and commit
  the trimmed typed text.

Empty input is a no-op on Enter — the consuming form decides
whether the field is required (and disables its submit button
accordingly per the standard form pattern).

### Configurability per use site

Use-site config props (informative; finalize at component
implementation):

- `sourceList: string[]` — the suggestions; may be empty / absent.
- `casingNormalization: 'canonical' | 'as-typed'` — default
  `canonical`. Use `as-typed` when the source list is hint-only
  rather than canonical (e.g., tag lists where users may
  intentionally re-case).
- `createTailLabel: string` — copy for the tail row; `+ Add new:
"{value}"` is the default template.
- `placeholder: string`, `required: boolean` — standard form
  affordances.

### Interaction with edit-restrictions

The component disables uniformly during in-flight pipelines, per
[`principles.md → Edit restrictions during in-flight generation`](../principles.md#edit-restrictions-during-in-flight-generation).
Disabled state shows the typed value (no dropdown, no tail row),
hover/focus reveals the same uniform tooltip every other gated
control uses.

### Storybook (autocomplete)

Live demos for: source-list-with-presets (era flip pattern),
empty-source (free-form-only behavior), casing-normalization
in action, the tail-create-on-new-typed-value state. Belongs in
the same `Patterns/Form controls/` Storybook tree as the Select
primitive when component implementation begins.

## TagInput pattern

Multi-value, iterative tag entry. Composes the
[Tag](./chips.md#tag--pill-labeled-content) and
[Input](#input-primitive) primitives into a single bordered surface
that accumulates committed tags as removable chips alongside an
inline typing input. Used wherever a `string[]` field needs
free-form labels — story tags, entity tags, lore tags, thread or
happening tags.

Distinct from
[Autocomplete-with-create](#autocomplete-with-create-primitive):
Autocomplete is **single-value, terminal "pick or create"**;
TagInput is **multi-value, stay-open iterative entry**. The full
identity argument lives in
[`docs/explorations/2026-05-06-tag-input-compound.md`](../../explorations/2026-05-06-tag-input-compound.md).

### Contract

```ts
type TagInputProps = {
  value: string[] // controlled
  onChange: (next: string[]) => void // fires on add + remove only

  placeholder?: string
  disabled?: boolean
  disabledReason?: string // web title-tooltip parity with Input
  'aria-invalid'?: boolean | 'true' | 'false'

  className?: string
  inputClassName?: string

  maxCount?: number // total tags ceiling, default unlimited
  maxTagLength?: number // per-tag char cap, default unlimited
}
```

Internal state is a single private `typed: string` draft. No
`inputValue` controlled prop, no `onCommit` callback separate from
`onChange`, no `commitOnBlur` toggle — a single emit-shape, a single
commit policy.

### Interaction model

**Commit triggers** (any of):

- **Enter / Return** — typed text (trimmed) commits if non-empty
  and non-duplicate. Input clears. Keyboard stays up
  (`blurOnSubmit={false}`) so iterative entry works without a
  re-tap.
- **Comma** — same as Enter, but the comma keystroke is consumed
  (doesn't render in the input).
- **Blur** — typed text commits if non-empty and non-duplicate.
  Input clears. Mobile convention across iOS Mail, Apple Notes,
  iOS Reminders, Material chip-input is overwhelmingly
  blur-commits; the asymmetric cost (data loss without it vs a
  junk chip the user can × off with it) makes blur-commits the
  right default, not a user toggle.
- **Paste** containing commas or newlines — split on `[,\n]+`,
  trim each piece, push the non-empty non-dupes in order.

**Removal triggers:**

- **× on chip** — removes that chip via Tag's `removable` slot.
  Input keeps focus.
- **Backspace on empty input** — removes the last chip. Web fires
  this via `onKeyPress`; native iOS has a known RN gotcha where
  Backspace on an empty input doesn't fire `onKeyPress` —
  workaround is `onSelectionChange` detecting selection at
  `{start: 0, end: 0}` after an unchanged content event. Web
  baseline; native parity is best-effort.

**Dedupe.** Case-insensitive
(`array.some(t => t.toLowerCase() === typed.toLowerCase())`). On
dedupe-rejection, **input clears anyway** — the user already has
that tag, no error surface needed. `toLowerCase()` (ASCII case fold)
is sufficient for v1; Unicode case folding via `toLocaleLowerCase()`
is a one-line upgrade if drift surfaces.

**Caps.** `maxCount` reached → input visually disabled, commits
become noops (chip × still works). `maxTagLength` → underlying
TextInput's `maxLength` prop; paste-split pieces over the cap are
truncated.

### Cross-tier shape

**Inline at every tier. No Sheet, no Popover.** The compound renders
directly inside whatever form-row hosts it.

- **Phone** — input min-height `control-lg` (44 px touch floor).
- **Tablet / Desktop** — input min-height `control-md`.
- **Stacked vs 2-col** — handled by the
  [form-row pattern](#form-rows--stacked-on-narrow-container) at the
  host level; TagInput just fills the input slot.

No `useTier()` dispatch inside the compound. Same component, same
layout, density-driven sizing.

### Visual layout

Single bordered surface (Input-shaped border, matching focus-ring).
Chips wrap inline alongside the typing input:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [sci-fi ×] [fantasy ×] [dystopia ×] [type tag…]  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Chips: `flex-row flex-wrap items-center gap-1.5`.
- Inline TextInput appended after the last chip with
  `flex-1 min-w-[60px]` so it grows but never disappears when
  chips fill the row.
- Focus state lifts to the wrapper (same pattern Input uses when
  adornments are present).

### Implementation flag

Verify the [Tag primitive](./chips.md#tag--pill-labeled-content)'s
chip-text behavior at long content during the build pass — confirm
whether long single tags wrap chip width past the surface or
truncate cleanly. Apply `numberOfLines={1}` together with
truncate-with-ellipsis on the chip if needed.

### Storybook (TagInput)

Live demos for: empty array (placeholder visible), populated array
(chip-row alongside appended input), commit-on-Enter / -comma /
-blur, paste-with-commas split, backspace-removes-last (web),
maxCount disabled state, maxTagLength truncation. Belongs in the
same `Patterns/Form controls/` tree as Select and Autocomplete
when component implementation begins.

### What this defers

- **Suggestions source.** If a host later wants reuse-from-pool
  (canonical taxonomy, project-wide dedupe), TagInput grows an
  optional `suggestions: string[]` prop with a popover/sheet beneath
  the input. v1 ships free-form-only; the extension axis stays
  clean.
- **Click-to-edit chip** (tap chip to edit text in-place) — v2+.
- **Drag-reorder** of accumulated chips — v2+.
