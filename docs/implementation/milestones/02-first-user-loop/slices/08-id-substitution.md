# Slice 2.8 — ID placeholder substitution library

## Metadata

- **Milestone:** [Milestone 2 — First user loop](../milestone.md)
- **Depends on:** none (pure library, zero runtime deps)
- **Blocks:** [Slice 2.3](./03-wizard.md) (opening-generation
  refs), [Slice 2.7](./07-wiring.md) (per-turn context idMap)

## Goal

The substitution layer between prefix-tagged UUIDs and the short
placeholders the LLM sees: `IdBiMap`, the generic pattern-driven
`substituteIds` walker, the parse-side reverse substitution with
temporary-handle registration for new-entity emission, and the
malformed-placeholder recoverable error class. Pure `lib/` module,
fully specced canonically — this slice is a faithful
implementation, not a design pass.

## Background

Entity IDs are stored as `char_<uuid>` etc.; prompts carry `c1` /
`l1` / `lo1`-style placeholders, allocated per LLM call. The
walker is recursive and type-agnostic — it pattern-matches any
string in the context against the LLM-facing-prefix UUID pattern,
so non-LLM-facing IDs (`entry_*`, `act_*`, `run_*`) pass through
untouched. M2 has two consumers: the wizard's opening generation
(structured-output refs constrained to the cast — at most the
minimal lead entity) and the per-turn context. The heavier
consumers (classifier, chapter-close) arrive in M3 / M5 against
this same surface.

## Required reading

- [`generation-pipeline.md → ID placeholder substitution`](../../../../generation-pipeline.md#id-placeholder-substitution)
  — the complete contract: walker, `IdBiMap`, lifecycle,
  new-entity emission, failure modes. This slice implements it
  verbatim.
- [`data-model.md → ID shape — kind-prefixed UUIDs throughout`](../../../../data-model.md#id-shape--kind-prefixed-uuids-throughout)
  — the prefix registry, LLM-facing vs non-LLM-facing kinds.

## Scope: in

- `IdBiMap` (allocate / lookup both directions, per-kind
  counters, scoped to a single LLM call).
- `substituteIds` walker (strings, arrays, objects; the
  `SUBSTITUTABLE_PREFIXES` pattern).
- Reverse substitution on parse (`parseAndSubstitute`-shaped
  helper): placeholders → UUIDs across a parsed structured
  output; temporary-handle registration when a response
  references a just-created entity again (the new-entity path —
  no M2 consumer emits creates, but the surface is part of the
  canonical contract and M3.2 consumes it unchanged).
- Malformed / unrecognized placeholder → the single recoverable
  error class the retry tier consumes.
- Public-API exposure through the module index per the `lib/*`
  rule.

## Scope: out

- Any integration wiring (2.3 / 2.7 own their call sites).
- New-entity UUID allocation policy beyond the spec (parse
  allocates; the consumers land in M3.2).

## Acceptance criteria

- Round-trip property: for an arbitrary nested fixture containing
  LLM-facing UUIDs, non-LLM-facing UUIDs, and plain strings —
  `parse(substitute(x))` restores exactly the LLM-facing IDs and
  touches nothing else.
- Same UUID appearing twice allocates one placeholder; counters
  are per-kind (`c1`, `c2`, `l1`); two maps don't share state.
- Unrecognized placeholder in a parse fixture raises the
  recoverable error class, not a throw-through.
- Temporary-handle registration: a fixture response creating an
  entity and re-referencing it by an LLM-chosen handle resolves
  both references to one allocated UUID.
- 100% line coverage on this module (pure logic; the bar is
  cheap here).

## Tests

- Vitest only: walker matrix, bimap units, reverse-parse cases,
  property-style round-trip over generated fixtures.

## Open questions

- None — the canonical spec leaves no design freedom; deviations
  found during implementation go back through the spec.

## Implementation notes

_Populated at finish: notable deviations from the plan and resolved developer decisions._
