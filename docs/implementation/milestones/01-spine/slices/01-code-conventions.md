# Slice 1.1 — Code conventions

## Metadata

- **Milestone:** [Milestone 1 — Spine](../milestone.md)
- **Depends on:** none (first slice)
- **Blocks:** 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5a, 1.5b, 1.6, 1.7 — every later slice
  authors `lib/*` modules under this slice's eslint rule.

## Goal

Land the canonical project conventions and the eslint rule that
enforces the `lib/*` public-API discipline. The rule applies to
every importer outside a module — including code outside `lib/`
(app routes, components, scripts) — which can reach a module only
through its `index.ts`. Three artefacts ship together: the
`eslint-plugin-boundaries` rule at `error` severity, the canonical
`docs/code-conventions.md` human-facing doc covering the full v1
convention set (module structure, state placement, action layer,
component taxonomy, i18n, testing, forms, pnpm), and the matching
`.claude/rules/code.md` citation block that references it from
agent-facing context.

The v2 trunk already carries three foundation modules from the
mobile-foundations track — `lib/density/`, `lib/themes/`,
`lib/toast/` — so this slice also retrofits them to the discipline:
it adds the missing `index.ts` barrels and redirects every external
deep-import to the module public API. No _new_ `lib/*` module is
introduced; the first new module (`lib/db/`) ships in Slice 1.2.

## Background

Each subdirectory of `lib/` is a module: internal files import each
other freely via relative paths; any importer outside the module
reaches it only through the module's `index.ts`. "Outside the
module" includes code outside `lib/` entirely — app routes and
components — so a catch-all element classifies them as known, which
is what makes the dependencies rule check their imports. The rule is
silent on imports from files that match no element, so leaving
importers unclassified would silently exempt them. Tests inside a
module may deep-import; tests outside use the public API only. Build
scripts are the deliberate exception — exempt, since they run under
`tsx` and cannot import the React-Native-coupled barrels. Types are
part of the public API — deep type imports are banned the same as
value imports.

V1 introduced a narrower version of this at warn-level near the end
of that codebase (`boundaries/dependencies` scoped to
`src/lib/services/*`) and never finished the migration. V2 raises
it to `'error'`, applies it to `lib/*`, and expresses index-only
entry through the plugin's `boundaries/dependencies` rule (v6
deprecates the older `entry-point` rule). The v2
trunk already carries three foundation modules (`density`,
`themes`, `toast`) from the mobile-foundations track; this slice
retrofits them rather than starting from an empty `lib/`.

## Required reading

- [`.claude/rules/code.md` → Import wildcards](../../../../../.claude/rules/code.md#import-wildcards)
  — existing pattern for eslint rules that enforce code
  discipline; this slice extends the same style with the
  boundaries plugin.
- [`.claude/rules/code.md` → Commenting discipline](../../../../../.claude/rules/code.md#commenting-discipline)
  — first canonical convention; this slice's `docs/code-conventions.md`
  cites rather than duplicates it.
- [`docs/conventions.md` → Cross-references](../../../../conventions.md#cross-references)
  — anchor-link convention for any new docs added in this slice.
- [`docs/implementation/lessons-learned/`](../../../lessons-learned/README.md)
  — implementation pitfalls already collected; the canonical doc
  points readers here for runtime-pattern gotchas.

## Scope: in

- Add `eslint-plugin-boundaries` (v6) and
  `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` to dev dependencies; install
  with `pnpm`.
- Extend `eslint.config.js`:
  - Register the `boundaries` plugin. Add an `import/resolver`
    setting (`typescript: { alwaysTryTypes: true }`) so boundaries
    resolves `@/` aliases (tsconfig maps `@/* → ./*`) and
    bare-directory imports to `index.ts`. Do not blanket-spread the
    plugin's `recommended` ruleset — it enables `element-types` /
    `no-unknown` enforcement this slice scopes out; configure the
    one rule à la carte.
  - Declare `boundaries/elements`: `lib-module` (pattern `lib/*`,
    mode `folder`) so a module's whole subtree is one element and
    intra-module imports stay internal; `lib-file` (`lib/*.ts`, mode
    `file`) for bare helpers like `utils.ts`; and a catch-all
    `app-code` (pattern `!(lib)/**`, mode `full`) that makes every
    source file outside `lib/` a known element. The catch-all
    excludes `lib/` so it does not shadow `lib-module` — boundaries
    matches path segments deepest-first, so a catch-all that also
    matched lib files would win and silently disable the rule — and
    it is needed because the rule skips imports originating from
    unknown files.
  - Add `boundaries/dependencies` at `'error'` (v6 deprecates
    `entry-point` and folds index-only enforcement into this rule):
    `default: 'allow'` with one `disallow` whose target is a
    `lib-module` internal file (`internalPath: '!index.ts'`). No
    `dependency.kind` filter, so value and type deep imports are
    both banned. Exempt `scripts/**` with a `'boundaries/dependencies':
'off'` override — build scripts run under `tsx` and cannot
    import the React-Native-coupled barrels.
- Bring the existing foundation modules into compliance:
  - Add `lib/density/index.ts` and `lib/themes/index.ts` barrels
    exporting each module's public API (derived from current
    consumers — e.g. `themes`, `useTheme`, `COLOR_SLOT_KEYS`,
    `Theme`, `ThemeColorSlots`, `ThemeProvider`, `contrastRatio` for
    `themes`).
  - Extend `lib/toast/index.ts` to also export `toastStore` (the
    `toast` API and severity types are already exported).
  - Redirect every external deep-import (~72 import lines across
    ~58 files in `components/`, `app/`, `.storybook/`, and story
    files) to the module public API. `scripts/` keeps its
    React-free deep imports (exempt). The `.native.tsx` provider
    variants must keep resolving per-platform through the barrel.
- Create `docs/code-conventions.md` covering:
  - **Module structure** — `lib/*` public-API rule (any importer
    outside the module, including code outside `lib/`, uses
    `index.ts`), internal vs external imports, test deep-import
    policy, types as part of the public API.
  - **State placement** — three-tier rule (component-local
    `useState` (React) for component-local state, cross-component
    ephemeral via `lib/stores/ui/`, domain-class Zustand stores
    exposing mutators only — no direct `setState` access from
    outside the store / action layer).
  - **Action layer** — single layer spans pipeline and UI
    writes; domain-organized (`lib/actions/<domain>/`); mediates
    Zustand and SQLite transactionally.
  - **Component folder taxonomy** — primitives → `components/ui/`;
    domain-agnostic compounds → `components/compounds/`;
    single-domain compounds → `components/<domain>/`; shells →
    `components/shells/`. Cites
    [`docs/ui/components.md → Directory layout`](../../../../ui/components.md#directory-layout).
  - **i18n discipline** — no raw user-facing strings in code; all
    chrome routes through `t()`. Convention-only this slice;
    eslint enforcement gates on `i18next` install in Slice 1.7
    (per
    [`milestone.md → Narrative`](../milestone.md#narrative--overview)).
  - **Testing discipline** — unit tests required on logic:
    `lib/*` modules, pure functions, reducers, state machines,
    classifier output parsers. UI smoke / Storybook / manual
    covers component behaviour. No coverage thresholds (they
    rot).
  - **Forms** — input clusters with a submit button use
    `react-hook-form`. Inline controlled inputs (single input
    without submit — rename, search, toggle row) stay
    component-local. Convention-only this slice; `react-hook-form`
    installs in Slice 2.3.
  - **pnpm + patches** — `pnpm` is the only supported package
    manager, enforced by `engines.pnpm` + `engine-strict=true` +
    `only-allow` preinstall guard. Patches live under
    [`patches/`](../../../../../patches/) and are referenced via
    `pnpm-lock.yaml` `patchedDependencies`.
  - **Commenting + import discipline** — citations to
    [`.claude/rules/code.md → Commenting discipline`](../../../../../.claude/rules/code.md#commenting-discipline)
    and
    [`.claude/rules/code.md → Import wildcards`](../../../../../.claude/rules/code.md#import-wildcards).
    Not duplicated; canonical home stays in `code.md` since the
    rules are agent-facing-first.
  - **Lessons-learned pointer** — link to
    [`docs/implementation/lessons-learned/`](../../../lessons-learned/README.md)
    with read-before-touching guidance.
- Extend `.claude/rules/code.md` with citing sections for every
  topic introduced in `docs/code-conventions.md` above
  (Module structure, State placement, Action layer, Component
  folder taxonomy, i18n, Testing, Forms, pnpm + patches,
  Lessons-learned). Each section is short and points to the
  canonical anchor — code.md owns Commenting + Import wildcards
  end-to-end and cites code-conventions.md for everything else.
- Update `docs/README.md` to add `code-conventions.md` to the
  `## What's here` index.
- Update `CLAUDE.md` `## Authoritative reading` to list
  `docs/code-conventions.md`.
- Update the `aventuras-*` dev skills that touch code
  (`aventuras-test-driven-development`,
  `aventuras-systematic-debugging`,
  `aventuras-receiving-code-review`,
  `aventuras-requesting-code-review`,
  `aventuras-verification-before-completion`,
  `aventuras-finishing-a-development-branch`) to cite
  `docs/code-conventions.md` in their preflight.

## Scope: out

- No _new_ `lib/*` modules. The first new module (`lib/db/`) ships
  in Slice 1.2. The existing `density` / `themes` / `toast`
  foundation modules are retrofitted here — see Scope: in.
- No policing of inter-element coupling beyond the `lib-module`
  public-API boundary. The catch-all `app-code` element is declared
  only so the dependencies rule sees those importers; which
  component may import which, or app-vs-electron boundaries, stays
  unrestricted. Tightening those is a future slice if cross-domain
  coupling becomes a concern.
- No new lint rules beyond the boundaries dependencies rule. The
  `no-console` ban already landed as scaffolding (it is in
  `eslint.config.js`); the logger that gives it a real target
  ships in Slice 1.3.
- No setter-from-domain-store lint ban — lands with the action
  layer / domain stores in Slice 1.5a or 1.6 once domain stores
  exist.
- No selective-re-export shape enforcement on `index.ts` files;
  convention-only, not mechanically enforced this slice.
- No eslint rule for raw user-facing strings — gates on
  `i18next` install in Slice 1.7.
- No eslint rule for `react-hook-form` usage on submit clusters
  — `react-hook-form` doesn't install until Slice 2.3; rule
  remains a code-review-only check.
- Lessons-learned migration, CLAUDE.md non-Claude-agent pointer
  block, and pnpm enforcement (`only-allow` + `engine-strict`)
  landed as scaffolding before this slice opens — not part of
  the slice's deliverable surface, but referenced by the
  canonical doc.

## Acceptance criteria

- `eslint-plugin-boundaries` (v6) and
  `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` listed in `package.json`
  devDependencies and locked in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- `eslint.config.js` registers the plugin, sets the
  `import/resolver` typescript setting, declares the elements, and
  includes the `boundaries/dependencies` rule at `'error'` severity
  restricting `lib-module` imports to its root `index.ts`
  (`scripts/**` exempt).
- `lib/density/index.ts` and `lib/themes/index.ts` exist and
  export each module's public API; `lib/toast/index.ts` also
  exports `toastStore`. No file outside a module deep-imports its
  internals.
- `docs/code-conventions.md` exists, covers Module structure,
  State placement, Action layer, Component folder taxonomy, i18n,
  Testing, Forms, pnpm + patches, Commenting / import (cites
  `code.md`), and Lessons-learned, and is listed in
  `docs/README.md` + `CLAUDE.md` `## Authoritative reading`.
- `.claude/rules/code.md` extended with citing sections for every
  topic introduced in the canonical doc; Commenting + Import
  wildcards remain end-to-end in `code.md`.
- All `aventuras-*` dev skills listed under Scope: in cite
  `docs/code-conventions.md` in their preflight.
- `pnpm lint` passes: the dependencies rule is live at `'error'`
  and the compliance refactor leaves zero violations. A deliberate
  deep-import of a module internal fails lint.
- `pnpm typecheck` passes and the existing `density` / `themes`
  vitest suites stay green after the import redirects.
- `pnpm lint:docs` passes — remark validates anchor links across
  the new and updated docs.

## Tests

No new unit tests for the plugin itself — it is upstream-tested,
and the existing `density` / `themes` vitest suites already cover
the modules' behaviour; those must stay green through the import
redirects. The rule is validated immediately and concretely: the
compliance refactor passing `pnpm lint` at `'error'` proves the
rule accepts public-API imports, and a deliberate deep-import
(value or type) proves it rejects internals. Cross-platform smoke
(web + native) confirms the `index.ts` barrels preserve the
`.native.tsx` provider resolution.

## Open questions

- **`.native.tsx` resolution through the barrels.** The `index.ts`
  barrels re-export the bare `density-provider` / `theme-provider` /
  `use-theme` specifiers, so Metro's platform resolution stays
  transparent (the `.native` variant on native, base on web).
  Typecheck and web resolution check out; a native run still owes
  the final smoke.

Resolved during implementation: the rule is `boundaries/dependencies`
at `'error'` (v6 deprecates `entry-point` and folds index-only
enforcement into it), with `lib-module` as a folder-mode element, an
`!(lib)/**` full-mode catch-all so importers outside `lib/` are
"known" without shadowing `lib-module` (boundaries matches segments
deepest-first), and a `disallow` on `lib-module` internals
(`internalPath: '!index.ts'`) covering value and type imports.
`eslint-import-resolver-typescript` plus the `import/resolver`
setting resolve `@/` aliases and bare-dir → `index.ts`; `scripts/**`
is exempt. Verified with `pnpm lint`: the compliance refactor is
clean and a deliberate value or type deep-import fails. `lib/*`
folder mode confirmed (a module's subtree is one element; `utils.ts`
is a separate `lib-file`). No synthetic `lib/_smoke/` fixture — the
existing foundation modules and the compliance
refactor exercise the rule live. Inter-element coupling stays out
of scope: the `disallow` only targets `lib-module` internals, so
this slice does not police which component imports which; that is a
future slice if cross-domain coupling becomes a concern.

## Implementation notes

_Populated at finish: notable deviations from the plan and resolved developer decisions._
