# No "harmless" id leaks — prune on disappearance

It's tempting to label leftover entries in an id-keyed collection
as "harmless because they aren't rendered" — `expandedIds`,
selection sets, scroll memory, etc. The leak **isn't** harmless
when the same id reappears later (Reset to defaults, undo,
reload-from-store), because the resurrected entry inherits the
stale state and silently breaks invariants downstream.

## Why

Aventuras `SuggestionCategoriesEditor` had `expandedIds: Set<string>`
retaining ghost ids after delete / clear. A Clear-then-Reset
re-introduces the SEED ids; the re-mounted row reads
`expanded={true}` from the stale set, the body renders inside an
overflow-hidden container that's still spring-growing from
estimated heights, the chevron animates open instantly — net
effect "chevron says open, body invisible." Looks like a desync
bug; was actually the leaked state.

## How to apply

When pruning is cheap (set / map keyed by id, you already iterate
the current id list in an effect), prune in the same pass.
Pattern:

```ts
setExpandedIds((prev) => {
  const next = new Set(prev)
  let changed = false
  for (const id of prev) {
    if (!currentIds.has(id)) {
      next.delete(id)
      changed = true
    }
  }
  // ... other mutations
  return changed ? next : prev // preserve reference if nothing actually changed
})
```

Bail-out when nothing changed (return `prev`) keeps the reference
stable so memo'd consumers don't re-render.

Doesn't apply when ids are guaranteed unique-forever (uuid / cuid in
append-only data) AND the data can't be restored — then leaks are
truly inert. But never assume "unique-forever" for ids the user
controls or that can be set from a constant seed.
