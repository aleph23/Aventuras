# Implementation triage

Inbox for cross-cutting deferrals surfaced during implementation that
have **no single downstream slice to own them** — the items that would
otherwise be dropped straight into [`followups.md`](../followups.md) or
[`parked.md`](../parked.md) and lost.

Drop them here first. This file is a **queue, not a ledger**: an item
living here means "not yet triaged," not "deferred forever." Triage
happens as a separate pass — each item is read, then routed to its real
home (a specific slice's Open questions, the active
[`followups.md`](../followups.md) ledger, [`parked.md`](../parked.md), a
canonical spec change) or deleted if it dissolves on inspection. Keep
the queue short; a growing inbox is the signal to triage.

A deferral that a **specific downstream slice** will own does not belong
here — it goes straight into that slice's Open questions, where the
slice-planning gate forces its resolution before that slice is planned.

## Inbox

- **M1.5-gate config defaults vs data-model prose.** Two `app_settings`
  defaults the gate shipped diverge from the data-model's prose and
  need reconciling (a prose fix, or a seeded value): (a)
  `default_calendar_id` is nullable — no calendar exists at first init
  (`vault_calendars` is unseeded) — but `data-model.md`'s App-settings
  storage types it `string`; (b) `ui_language` defaults to `'en'` in the
  config schema, but the data-model says "defaults to OS locale on first
  launch" — the OS-locale seed belongs in the boot / onboarding path,
  not a static schema default. Routes to the calendar domain (M8.3) and
  an onboarding / boot slice respectively.
- **Happening delete orphans its link rows** (M3/M4). `deleteHappening`
  (slice M01b/04) removes only the `happenings` row — `happening_involvements`
  and `happening_awareness` are FK-less link tables, so their rows are left
  orphaned. Cascade/reconcile is a Tier-2 composition deferred to its
  consumers: the M3 classifier reconcile and the M4 Plot delete-flow. Route to
  whichever of those slices is authored first.
- **Era-flip worldtime reorders vs the non-deferrable unique index**
  (M5/M7). `branch_era_flips` carries `uniqueIndex(branch_id, at_worldtime)`
  (migration `0003`, slice M01b/05). Each `applyDeltaAction` writes one
  delta, so single-action reverse-replay is collision-free. But if a future
  orchestrator batches multiple `at_worldtime` updates into **one** action,
  the batched undo statements run in a single transaction against a
  non-`DEFERRABLE` index — an intermediate undo state could transiently
  violate uniqueness and throw even when the final state is valid. Needs
  deferred-constraint handling or per-row sequencing in the batching layer.
  Zero callers today (the slice ships primitives only). Route to whichever
  of M5 (chapter-close) / M7.2 (era-flip UX) first batches era-flip writes.
