## Decisions

_Each subsection captures a design choice and why we made it. Fill in as we go._

### Checkpoint model

**Decided:** no first-class "checkpoint" concept. The old app used checkpoints
as plumbing to enable rollback and branching; in v2 those operations work at
AI-reply granularity directly, so checkpoints-as-user-feature disappear.
Optional user-named bookmarks (game-save style) may return later as a UI
affordance, fully decoupled from the rollback/branch machinery.

### Branch model

**Decided:** any `story_entry` is a valid branch point — symmetric with
rollback. **No chapter-boundary restrictions on either** (we explicitly
considered bounding rollback/branching by the latest closed chapter, and
rejected it: that would re-introduce checkpoint-style gatekeeping we went
out of our way to drop).

Branching is a **hard fork** — the new branch is fully standalone,
including its change history. On creation from entry N (where
`L = min(log_position)` among entry (N+1)'s deltas, or the head if N is
the latest entry):

1. Copy parent's CURRENT rows for every branch-scoped table (entities,
   lore, threads, happenings, happening_involvements, happening_awareness,
   chapters, branch_era_flips, story_entries 1..N, entry_assets tied to
   those entries) into the new branch.
2. Copy parent's deltas with `log_position < L` into the new branch — so
   the new branch carries the complete history up to the fork point and
   rollback on the new branch can reach any entry 1..N.
3. Reverse-apply parent's deltas with `log_position >= L` onto the new
   branch's copied rows. These rewind the copies from "parent's current
   state" to "state as of entry N." The post-fork deltas themselves are
   NOT copied — their only purpose was to rewind, and keeping them would
   contradict the rewound state.

Assets are never copied — `entry_assets` rows copy (tiny) but point at
the same asset IDs on disk. Hard-fork for narrative data, shared-by-reference
for binary media.

Reads on the new branch are always fast because state is pre-materialized
— no lineage walk, no copy-on-write. Branch creation cost is linear in
rows + post-fork delta count; both are modest.

**Primary keys on all branch-scoped tables are composite `(branch_id, id)`.**
The `id` is a UUID generated once at row creation and never regenerated.
On branch copy, `INSERT ... SELECT` flips branch_id and leaves everything
else (including id and all internal references) verbatim. Cross-references
— FK columns AND id-references buried inside `entities.state` JSON
(`parent_location_id`, `current_location_id`, `equipped_by`, etc.) — stay
valid because they all resolve within the new branch's scope automatically.
The alternative (single-column UUID PK + generate-fresh-on-copy) would
require walking every reference site including state JSON to rewrite IDs
during copy; that's where bugs would hide forever. Composite PK sidesteps
the whole category. Tables at the global scope (`stories`, `assets`) keep
single-column PKs since they aren't branched.

Text duplication across branches is acceptable (one data point: a 350k-word
story exported as JSON is ~2.5MB — branches at 10x are still tiny). The
one thing that would have exploded is binary media, which we externalize
(see Assets below). Branches share assets via reference, not copy.

Deep rollback across multiple closed chapters is allowed; it simply
reverses more deltas (including the lore-agent's writes, memory
compaction's consolidations, and the chapter-row itself — all logged as
deltas so all reversible). UI surfaces a soft warning ("this will undo 3
chapters of agent work"), not a hard block.

### World-state storage

**Decided:** one unified `entities` table for actors (character, location,
item, faction) with a `kind` discriminator, a typed-JSON `state` column,
and a `status` lifecycle (staged | active | retired). Collapses the old
app's dual world-state-vs-lorebook design — the "staged lorebook character
not yet introduced" use case becomes `status = staged` on an entity.

Reference material (magic systems, religions, cosmology, IP-specific
terminology — things that _are_, not things that _happen_) lives in a
separate `lore` table. No structured state, no lifecycle — purely retrieval
fodder. `lore` is per-branch (same snapshot-at-fork model as entities) so
users can edit static lore as the story evolves and the AI can organically
introduce new lore without polluting sibling branches.

Historical/scheduled events are NOT lore — they moved to `happenings` (see
below), because events are things that occurred/will occur and participate
in character knowledge in a way static reference doesn't.

`entities` gains a `retired_reason` freeform text column alongside
`status`, only meaningful when `status=retired` ("killed by Kael",
"faction disbanded after coup", etc.).

#### Description vs `state` boundary

`entities.description` (top-level text column) is the
**user-authoritative "who" prose**. State is the **typed,
classifier-mutable layer** carrying everything that needs structure
for query, classifier evolution, or prompt rendering.

The split rule:

- **Description** holds the prose-y identity sketch. Whoever spawns
  the entity authors the initial description (user via wizard /
  `+ New entity` → user-authored; classifier via mid-story discovery
  → classifier-authored once). Subsequent writes are **user-only**
  in v1.
- **State** holds typed slots for: things that evolve mid-stream
  (classifier needs structural slots to record changes), things
  needed structurally (entity refs, hierarchy walks, caches), and
  things the UI needs as discrete fields rather than parsed from
  prose.

The classifier writes prose well at _introduction_ moments; mid-stream
description rewrites risk coherence drift across long stories. Keeping
description as a stable user-authoritative surface protects the entity's
"who" from per-turn churn; typed state slots absorb the per-turn /
per-chapter evolution.

**v1 collapse:** the lore-management agent suggestion-queue UI
(autonomous-vs-confirm-mode toggle on classifier-proposed description
revisions) is deferred. Until it ships, classifier never updates
description after first introduction; user is the only ongoing editor.
Stale descriptions are the user's problem until they edit — acceptable
v1 floor. The suggestion-queue UI is a separate UX design pass; the
broader memory-mgmt design landed in
[`docs/memory/`](./memory/README.md).

#### `CharacterState` shape

```ts
type CharacterState = {
  // Identity — visual descriptors (type-relaxed strings, no enum lock-in)
  visual: {
    physique?: string // height + build merged
    face?: string // facial features, complexion, expression-tendency
    hair?: string // color + style + state
    eyes?: string // color + distinctive eye traits
    attire?: string // live current attire — classifier-updates on observed change
    distinguishing?: string[] // catch-all: scars, tattoos, voice tone, gait, posture, scent
  }

  // Identity — personality + motivation
  traits: string[] // who they are: personality / skills / background; soft cap 8
  drives: string[] // what pushes/pulls them: goals, fears, sore spots; soft cap 6
  voice?: string // single prose note on speech pattern

  // Entity-graph references — split across UI tabs (Connections + Carrying)
  current_location_id: EntityId | null
  equipped_items: EntityId[] // unique items only (worn/wielded)
  inventory: EntityId[] // unique items only (carried, not active)
  stackables?: Record<string, number> // currencies + ammo + supplies
  // string-keyed quantities, lowercase canonical
  faction_id: EntityId | null // primary affiliation, single

  // Cache (classifier-maintained denormalization)
  lastSeenAt: {
    entryId: string
    locationId: string | null
    worldTime: number
  } | null
}
```

**Visual descriptors are type-relaxed strings**, not enums. Enum
vocabularies don't survive contact with genre flexibility — "disposition"
in romance vs war saga vs eldritch horror demands different vocabularies.
Free strings let the classifier write whatever fits the prose; field
names stay stable for UI and translation.

**`attire` is live current attire**, not signature. Classifier updates on
observed prose change ("Kael changed into noble robes"). Staleness risk
is acknowledged; mitigation is prompting discipline + chapter-close
compaction.

**`traits` and `drives` are flat string arrays.** Symmetric shape; UI
renders as chip groups; classifier emits one element at a time. A third
`behaviors` bag was considered and rejected — "negotiates before fighting"
is functionally a trait ("diplomatic") or a drive ("avoids violence");
separate bag silently bloats with mis-classified entries.

**`voice` is single-string, optional.** Distinct from `distinguishing[]`
because dialogue-coherence demands voice be surfaced explicitly; folding
into distinguishing buries it.

**`equipped_items` vs `inventory` asymmetry.** Both are `EntityId[]` of
unique items; the split is semantic — equipped is what's actively in use,
inventory is what's carried but stowed. Stackables don't go through
either; they live in the separate `stackables` slot.

**`lastSeenAt`** drives "last seen 3 days ago in The Tavern" UX on the
World panel and Browse rail; without caching, surfacing this would
require walking entry history per row on every render. Classifier
updates whenever the character is present in `metadata.sceneEntities`
of a new entry (or is the location's anchor via
`metadata.currentLocationId`).

#### Stackable items — holder-side `Record<string, number>`, not entities

Fungible items (currencies, ammunition, generic supplies) are NOT
modeled as entities. They're string-keyed quantities held on the
character via `stackables`.

**Why not item entities + count.** An earlier draft proposed an
`is_stackable` flag on `ItemState` plus a counted-inventory shape. The
classifier-prompt cost was prohibitive: to dedup stackables on creation,
the classifier would need to inspect "all stackable items in the branch"
(or accept duplicate entities for chapter-close compaction to merge).
Either route adds real prompt-token cost or intermediate-state noise.
The shape is also over-modeled — gold pieces don't need descriptions,
conditions, or any entity machinery; they're just quantities.

**Convention:**

- Lowercase canonical keys (`"gold"`, not `"Gold"` or `"Gold pieces"`).
- Cross-character consistency is classifier-prompt discipline +
  lore-mgmt compaction (key normalization at chapter close).
- Transfer ("Aria gives Kael 50 gold") writes deltas under one matching
  `action_id`: decrement on Aria's `stackables.gold`, increment-or-create
  on Kael's.
- Depletion: decrement; if count → 0, remove the key from the Record.

**v1 limitations** — locations don't get stackables (loose-fungibles-at-
locations stay in prose); named fungibles with descriptions ("magical
arrows blessed by Vael") aren't well-supported (model as a unique item
entity covering the whole batch, or narrate). Both tracked in followups.

#### Containers — descriptive-only in v1

Container items (satchel, quiver, purse, chest) exist as ordinary item
entities; their _contents_ live on whoever holds the container
(character.inventory + character.stackables). The "in the satchel"
relationship is narrative texture, not structural.

Structural one-level containment (`is_container` + `contained_*` on
`ItemState`) was considered and deferred — cycle prevention, transfer-
cascade complexity, and a holder-tree UI add cost most narratives don't
need. Additive future: those fields can land in v1.5 without breaking
v1 data; existing satchel entities just gain them when filled in.

UX consequence: users expecting D&D-grade "drag gold into purse" find
that gold lives on the character, not in the purse. UI labels say
"Carried items" / "Carried quantities" at the character level, not
"Satchel contents." Container items get a flagged display with a
tooltip ("Container — contents are tracked on the holder").

#### `LocationState` shape

```ts
type LocationState = {
  parent_location_id: EntityId | null // compositional hierarchy
  condition?: string // ongoing dynamic state delta from description baseline
  // ("war-damaged", "abandoned since the plague")
}
```

**`parent_location_id`** is a self-referential reference to another
entity where `kind=location`, giving locations a containment hierarchy
(Shop → Town Square → City). Distinct from characters'
`current_location_id` / items' `at_location_id`, which are _positional_
(where something is right now); `parent_location_id` is _compositional_
(this place is part of that place). Prompt rendering walks the parent
chain at runtime (e.g. `Aria is in [Shop in Town Square in City]`).
Cycle prevention is app-layer — SQLite can't enforce it.

**Why so few fields.** Locations are dramatically less dynamic than
characters. Type, appearance, atmosphere, landmark features all
naturally live in `description` prose, established at spawn time and
edited by the user when needed. Discrete change events (the bell
tower fell, the gate was breached) are recorded as `happenings` rows
with the location as a participant via `happening_involvements` — not
as state mutations. State carries the _running consequence_ (`condition:
"earthquake-damaged"`), not the event log.

#### `ItemState` shape

```ts
type ItemState = {
  at_location_id: EntityId | null // location of item if loose;
  // null when held by a character
  // (look up via character.equipped_items / inventory)
  condition?: string // dynamic state ("intact", "broken",
  //                "cursed", "activated")
}
```

**Position convention.** `at_location_id = null` means "held by a
character — find via character arrays." Single source of truth in the
held direction (character arrays are canonical for held items); no
back-pointer on item to drift against. Cost: "who holds the silver
coin?" requires scanning characters' equipped + inventory arrays.
Acceptable for v1 scale; FTS5 upgrade applies if it bites.

**Why so few fields.** What an item _is_ (type, material, properties,
magical traits, history, value) fits cleanly in description prose.
Position and dynamic condition are the two things that genuinely
need typed slots.

#### `FactionState` shape

```ts
type FactionState = {
  standing?: string // dynamic power/situation
  // ("ascendant after the coup", "embattled in the south")
  agenda?: string[] // current goals/objectives; soft cap 4
}
```

Identity (ideology, history, structure, founding circumstances,
signature reputation) lives in description prose. `standing` is the
faction's dynamic-state slot (parallel to LocationState.condition);
`agenda` parallels character `drives` with a tighter cap because
faction-level goals are coarser-grained than individual motivations.

Member roster derives from inverse query on `character.faction_id`;
inter-faction relationships fold into the deferred relationships-graph
followup.

#### Soft caps + compaction discipline

Schema does NOT enforce field-count caps via Zod `.max()` (would
create production write-rejection drama on classifier overflow). Bloat
is mitigated structurally:

- **Soft caps in classifier prompt.** `traits ≤ 8`, `drives ≤ 6`,
  `agenda ≤ 4`. Classifier prompt explicitly directs "replace, don't
  append" when at cap.
- **No per-turn classifier write to traits / drives / agenda.** These
  slow-evolving identity fields update only at chapter-close
  lore-mgmt agent. Per-turn pipeline handles scene metadata,
  `lastSeenAt`, `current_location_id`, attire changes,
  `equipped_items` / `inventory` / `stackables` transfers.
  Personality / behavioral / motivational fields lag scene-by-scene
  observations by up to one chapter — the right cadence for these
  fields specifically.
- **Chapter-close compaction (lore-mgmt agent).** Dedupes synonyms
  ("brave" + "courageous" → one), prunes outdated ("former alcoholic"
  10 chapters past sobriety → drop), consolidates overly-specific
  entries. The long-term bloat fix; soft caps are the per-turn
  discipline.

Cadence stratification is `architecture.md` territory; this section
declares the _requirement_ (compaction at chapter close), not the
agent design.

**Zod degradation bounds** (separate from soft caps — these are
"don't crash on pathological values" caps, much higher than the
prompt-discipline caps): `voice.max(2000)` characters; `traits` /
`drives` / `agenda` arrays `.max(50)`; `distinguishing.max(20)`;
each visual sub-field `.max(500)`; `condition` / `standing`
`.max(500)`; `stackables` keys non-empty + `.max(40)` characters;
`stackables` values non-negative integers.

#### Translation targets

The [`translations`](#translation) table can address state fields
via dotted paths. The split:

**Translatable** (text content the user faces in different languages):

- All `visual.*` sub-fields (string and per-element of `distinguishing[]`).
- `traits[]`, `drives[]`, `voice` per element / single string.
- `condition` (Location, Item).
- `standing` (Faction).
- `agenda[]` per element.

**Not translatable** (structural / numeric):

- All `EntityId` references (`current_location_id`, `equipped_items`,
  `inventory`, `parent_location_id`, `at_location_id`, `faction_id`).
- `lastSeenAt` (numeric snapshot).
- `stackables` keys — translatable in principle, but key normalization
  across characters is structurally complex; v1 treats keys as
  canonical lowercase English, untranslated. The _concept_ (gold) is
  rendered translated in narrative prose; the key is a structural
  identifier.
- `stackables` values (numeric counts).

#### Authorship contract

Per-field "who writes / when":

| Field group                                 | First write                                  | Subsequent writes                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` (top-level)                   | Whoever spawns the entity                    | User-only in v1                                           |
| `visual.*`                                  | Classifier from prose, or user via form      | Both — classifier evolves on observed prose change        |
| `traits`, `drives`                          | Classifier from prose                        | Classifier (chapter-close lore-mgmt only) + user via form |
| `voice`                                     | Classifier from prose, or user via form      | Both                                                      |
| `current_location_id`                       | Classifier per-turn                          | Classifier per-turn primary; user can edit                |
| `equipped_items`, `inventory`, `stackables` | Classifier per-turn                          | Classifier per-turn primary; user can edit                |
| `faction_id`                                | Classifier or user                           | Both                                                      |
| `lastSeenAt`                                | Classifier-only                              | Classifier-only                                           |
| `parent_location_id`                        | User at creation, or classifier on discovery | Both — rare changes                                       |
| `condition` (Location/Item)                 | Classifier or user                           | Both                                                      |
| `standing`, `agenda` (Faction)              | Classifier or user                           | Classifier (chapter-close) + user                         |
| `at_location_id` (Item)                     | Classifier per-turn                          | Classifier per-turn primary; user can edit                |

Manual user edit vs classifier overwrite policy is parked as an
architecture concern. v1 lean: classifier writes from prose-evidenced
changes; user edits "stick" only until classifier reads contradicting
prose. Per-field provenance metadata (deferred to v1.5) is the proper
fix.

The full design rationale, alternatives considered, and adversarial
findings are recorded in
[`explorations/2026-04-29-entities-state-shape.md`](./explorations/2026-04-29-entities-state-shape.md).

### Story identity fields

**Decided:** `stories` gains identity metadata as columns (not inside
the JSON blobs). Columns where the library needs filter/sort/search
access; JSON reserved for shape that doesn't require direct SQL
queries.

- `tags json` — `string[]`. Indexable via `json_each` for
  search/filter. Not shown on library cards (tag phrases are longer
  than chip format tolerates).
- `cover_asset_id text FK → assets.id` — optional. Cards are
  text-first; covers are a power-user enhancement, rendered in a
  future visual-identity pass.
- `accent_color text` — optional hex/HSL. Falls back to mode-derived
  default (Adventure blue, Creative purple) when null.
- `status text` — lifecycle enum `draft | active | archived`,
  mutually exclusive.
  - `draft` is only reachable via wizard save; transitions to
    `active` on wizard completion and is not user-togglable from the
    library afterward.
  - `active ↔ archived` toggle via overflow menu.
  - Drafts cannot be archived (archive action is gated on
    `status='active'`); they can only be completed or deleted.
- `favorite integer` — 0 or 1. Orthogonal to `status` — any status
  can be favorited. Inline star toggle on the library card. Naming
  parallels the per-row `favorite` flag on `vault_calendars`.
- `description text` — freeform user-text slot for the story's
  blurb / log line / running notes. Shown on library cards
  (3-line ellipsis). Not injected into any LLM prompt; purely
  the user's own context surface.
- `last_opened_at integer` — distinct from `updated_at` (which
  reflects any write). Touched when the user navigates into the
  story; drives the default `last-opened` sort on the library.

**Library sort invariant:** `favorite DESC, <chosen_sort_key>` —
favorited stories always float to the top within any filter. Mirrors
the Layer 0 rule for lead-character sort on entity lists.

### Story settings shape

**Decided:** `stories` carries TWO zod-parsed JSON blobs, split by
lifecycle:

- **`definition`** — definitional content (what the story IS).
  Wizard-authored at story creation; no global default. Edits propagate
  to all branches of the story (definition is story-level, not
  branch-level).
- **`settings`** — operational config (how it generates). Copy-at-
  creation from `app_settings.default_story_settings`; story owns its
  values thereafter. Some fields use override-at-render instead
  (models only).

Both are parsed with defaults applied at load time (parse mechanics
in architecture.md → "Settings: strict types, defaults at load").
The split mirrors the two-section left rail of the
[Story Settings screen](./ui/screens/story-settings/story-settings.md):
`definition` ↔ Story section, `settings` ↔ Settings section.

**`stories.definition` shape:**

```ts
stories.definition: {
  // Author-relationship
  mode: 'adventure' | 'creative'
  leadEntityId: string | null       // see cross-field constraint below; must reference entity with kind=character
  narration: 'first' | 'second' | 'third'

  // Substantial prompt content — preset+prose hybrid (see "Genre + tone preset+prose hybrid" below)
  genre: { label: string; promptBody: string }
  tone:  { label: string; promptBody: string }

  // Substantial prompt content — freeform
  setting: string                   // freeform prose; the world / time / place

  // World time — see calendar-systems/spec.md for the primitive
  calendarSystemId: string          // references CalendarSystem.id in the calendar registry
                                    //   (built-ins in code + user-authored in vault_calendars);
                                    //   seeded from app_settings.default_calendar_id at creation
  worldTimeOrigin: TierTuple        // Record<tierName, number> matching the active calendar's tier shape
                                    //   Earth: { year, month, day, hour, minute, second }
                                    //   Shire: { year, month, day }
                                    //   Stardate: { count }
}
```

**Cross-field constraint** (enforced at the zod boundary on
`definition`):

```
narration ∈ { 'first', 'second' }  →  leadEntityId != null
```

A first- or second-person story has a lead by definition (whose "I"
or "you" the narrator inhabits). Coexists with the existing
`mode='adventure' → leadEntityId != null` rule; either alone is
sufficient to require a lead. Wizard rejects commit; Story Settings
rejects save. Creative + third-person + null lead remains valid (the
omniscient-narrator ensemble case).

**`stories.settings` shape (operational only):**

```ts
stories.settings: {
  // Memory — defaults copied from App Settings → Story Defaults at creation.
  // Full design in docs/memory/cadence.md and docs/memory/retrieval.md.
  chapterTokenThreshold: number     // default 24000
  chapterAutoClose: boolean         // auto-close at threshold; off = threshold is guidance only, user wraps manually; default true
  recentBuffer: number              // last N entries verbatim in LLM context, regardless of chapter boundaries; default 10
  fullChapterInBuffer: boolean      // current chapter always verbatim in LLM context, in addition to recentBuffer; default false
  classifierCadence: { mode: 'turns' | 'token-trigger', value: number }  // when the periodic classifier runs in the background
  piggybackMode: 'on' | 'off'       // capability-gated; on = narrative emits structured trailing block; off = separate per-turn classifier pass
  embeddingBackend: 'provider' | 'local'   // embedding runtime (provider endpoint OR bundled local ONNX); both produce identical retrieval algorithm
  embedding_model_id: string        // canonical embedding model id; copied from app_settings.embedding_model_id at story creation. Locked thereafter unless the user explicitly re-indexes via the model swap UX. Different stories may carry different model ids; vec0 partitions per branch. See docs/memory/retrieval.md → Storage and Model swap UX
  retrievalMode: 'embedding' | 'llm-only'  // set at story creation, immutable thereafter; llm-only is the embedding-unavailable fallback regime
  retrievalBudgets: {                // per-type token budgets, hard partitions in v1 (no spillover); see docs/memory/retrieval.md → Per-type retrieval budgets
    entities: number
    lore: number
    happenings: number
    threads: number
    chapters: number                 // chapter summaries pool
  }

  // Composer
  composerModesEnabled: boolean     // adventure-only; creative ignores
  composerWrapPov: 'first' | 'third' // how composer modes wrap user input (NOT narration)
  suggestionsEnabled: boolean       // gates next-turn suggestion pane

  // Translation
  translation: {
    enabled: boolean
    targetLanguage: string | null   // ISO 639-1
    granularToggles: {
      narrative: boolean
      entityNames: boolean
      entityDescriptions: boolean
      lore: boolean
      threads: boolean
      happenings: boolean
      chapterMeta: boolean
    }
  }

  // Models — override-at-render pattern. Keys are agent ids drawn from the
  // assignments registry (single source of truth, evolves over time);
  // narrative is the always-present storyteller slot. Image generation is
  // deferred past v1 — `imageGen` returns when the feature lands.
  // `memory-compaction` was dropped — chapter-close lore-mgmt subsumes its
  // role per the cadence stratification; see docs/memory/chapter-close.md.
  models: {
    narrative?: string              // absent = use current global app-settings default at render time
    classifier?: string
    translation?: string
    suggestion?: string
    'lore-mgmt'?: string             // kebab-case agent ids match the UI labels in app-settings + story-settings Models tabs
    retrieval?: string               // mode-3 LLM-only retrieval agent OR keyword_llm fallback consumer
  }

  // Pack
  activePackId: string | null
  packVariables: Record<string, unknown>  // values keyed by variable name; zod-validated per active pack's declared schema
}
```

`compactionDetail` (a freeform user prose directive on the prior
schema) is **dropped** in this design pass. The original
"memory-compaction agent" it directed no longer exists — chapter-
close lore-mgmt subsumes its role per
[docs/memory/chapter-close.md](./memory/chapter-close.md). Power
users can author packs that bias prompts more rigorously than a
one-line soft hint.

#### Genre + tone preset+prose hybrid

Both `genre` and `tone` carry the same shape: a short `label` (used
in chrome — library-card overline, etc.) and a multi-paragraph
`promptBody` (substantial prose injected into generation context).
Wizard selection is **preset-driven** with snapshot copy:

- User picks from a bundled preset catalog (Hard sci-fi / Cozy
  fantasy / Noir / …); the preset's `displayName` copies into
  `label`, the preset's `promptBody` copies into `promptBody`.
- User can edit either freely afterward.
- **Fire-and-forget** — no preset id stored on the story. App
  updates that change the bundled preset don't propagate to existing
  stories. Mirrors the calendar-clone pattern (see
  [Vault content storage](#vault-content-storage)).
- **No-preset path:** preset selection is optional; user can skip
  and author label + prose from scratch.

Preset catalog lives in code (bundled JSON, ~20-30 entries each for
v1). User-authored presets in Vault are deferred —
[Vault genre + tone preset content types](./parked.md#vault-genre--tone-preset-content-types)
captures the post-v1 path.

#### Why two JSON columns, not promoting to columns

Each definitional compound field (`genre`, `tone`, `worldTimeOrigin`)
needs a JSON-typed column anyway — promoting to columns yields no
query benefit and adds schema rigidity for every future definitional
addition. JSON keeps the shape additive. The library-card genre
overline reads `definition.genre.label` via `json_extract`;
performance is fine for thousands of stories, and an indexed
expression solves any future scale.

The previous single-`settings` shape semantically overloaded "settings"
to mean both definitional content and operational config. The split
disentangles them and matches the UI's two-section structure.

**Scope policy — two patterns for global vs story.**

1. **Copy-at-creation** (operational + UX prefs — `stories.settings`).
   App Settings exposes a **"Story Defaults"** section holding the
   `settings` field shape (the underlying schema field is
   `app_settings.default_story_settings`; the UI label is "Story
   Defaults"). On story creation the current globals are copied into
   the new story's `settings`. After creation, the story owns its
   values; changing the global default does NOT propagate to existing
   stories.
2. **Override-at-render** (`settings.models` only). Fields are
   optional; absent means "use the global app-settings default at
   render time." Changing the global propagates to every
   un-overridden story. The UX difference (Models' dashed-italic "App
   default: X" sentinel vs copy-at-creation fields showing a concrete
   value) derives directly from this pattern split.

Most operational fields seed from `app_settings.default_story_settings`;
a few — `default_provider_id`, `default_calendar_id` — sit as
top-level sibling fields on `app_settings` because they're single-id
pointers into a registry rather than full state copies. Same
copy-at-creation semantics; just a different source path.

**`stories.definition` follows neither pattern** — every field is
wizard-authored per story; no global default exists. Definitional
fields are `definition`'s entire scope by construction.

**`stories.definition` fields are NOT translation targets.** The
substantial prose in `genre.promptBody` / `tone.promptBody` /
`setting` is user-typed source-language input consumed by the AI
during generation; it's not AI-output displayed in different UI
languages. The translations table targets AI-output content (entities,
lore, threads, happenings, story_entries) — not author-input fields.

**Narration vs composer wrap POV — orthogonal axes, often confused.**
`narration` governs how the AI writes prose (`first | second | third`
person). `composerWrapPov` governs how the composer's lazy-input modes
(Do/Say/Think) wrap user text into sendable form. These are distinct:
second-person narration doesn't imply wrapping user input as "You
reach for..." — that would produce nonsense. Composer wrap POV is
restricted to `first | third` (second not offered); narration has all
three.

### App settings storage

**Decided:** global app config lives in a single-row `app_settings`
table keyed on `id = 'singleton'`. Heavy use of JSON columns;
schema can normalize into per-domain tables later if a real reason
emerges. For v1 the JSON-blob approach trades schema rigour for
fewer migrations during the rapid-iteration period.

**Provider instances — multi-instance, user-managed.**

```ts
app_settings.providers: Array<{
  id: string                                 // stable UUID per instance
  type: 'anthropic' | 'openai' | 'google' | 'openrouter' | 'nanogpt' | 'nvidia-nim' | 'openai-compatible'
  displayName: string                        // user-chosen; e.g. 'Anthropic (work)'
  apiKey: string                             // see encryption note below
  endpoint?: string                          // override default; required for openai-compatible
  customHeaders?: Record<string, string>     // proxy auth, custom routing
  pinnedModelIds: string[]                   // user's working set; floats to top of selectors
  cachedModels?: Array<{                     // result of /models fetch; survives offline restarts
    id: string
    capabilities?: { reasoning?: boolean; structuredOutput?: boolean }
  }>
  cachedAt?: number                          // last successful /models fetch timestamp
}>
```

`app_settings.default_provider_id` references one of the above; the
default seeds Narrative profile creation and "Reset to defaults"
actions across the rest of the app.

**Model profiles — narrative + agents.**

```ts
app_settings.profiles: Array<{
  id: string                                 // stable UUID
  kind: 'narrative' | 'agent'                // narrative is special-cased (always present, undeletable)
  name: string                               // 'Narrative' / 'Fast tasks' / 'Heavy reasoning' / etc.
  description?: string                       // user-authored, agent profiles only
  modelRef: { providerId: string; modelId: string }  // composite — disambiguates same modelId across providers
  temperature?: number                       // 0-1
  maxOutput?: number
  thinking?: number                          // reasoning slider; conditional on model capability
  timeout?: number                           // seconds; default 60
  structuredOutput?: 'auto' | 'force-on' | 'force-off'  // agent profiles only
  customJson?: Record<string, unknown>       // advanced — per-field merge over constructed payload
}>
```

`modelRef` is a composite `{ providerId, modelId }` rather than a
bare model id string — the same model id can exist on multiple
provider instances (e.g. two Anthropic keys, two OpenAI-compatible
endpoints). The composite resolves unambiguously.

**Assignments — which profile each agent uses.**

```ts
app_settings.assignments: Record<AgentId, string>  // agentId → profile.id
```

The `AgentId` registry is the single source of truth for which
agents exist. v1 ships:
`classifier | translation | suggestion | lore-mgmt | memory-compaction | retrieval | wizard-assist`.
Narrative is not an agent — it's the storyteller, always wired to
the `kind: 'narrative'` profile, no assignment slot needed.

`wizard-assist` backs all AI calls fired from the
[Story creation wizard](./ui/screens/wizard/wizard.md) (title chips,
description / genre / tone / setting / opening prose, cast and lore
list suggestions). One agent serves the whole wizard surface;
splitting per-call-shape is a parked concern (see
[parked.md → Wizard-assist agent profile splitting](./parked.md#wizard-assist-agent-profile-splitting)).

**Default models — render-time resolver fallback.**

```ts
app_settings.default_models: Record<AgentId, { providerId: string; modelId: string }>
```

This is the **override-at-render** target referenced by
`stories.settings.models[agentId]`. When a story doesn't override
an agent's model, the resolver returns the corresponding entry
here. Changing a default propagates to every un-overridden story
on next render. Distinct from `assignments` (which controls the
LLM-call parameter envelope via profile lookup) — defaults are
about model selection, profiles are about call configuration.

**Story Defaults (`default_story_settings`) — copy-at-creation source.**

```ts
app_settings.default_story_settings: Partial<StorySettings>
```

Mirrors the operational
[`stories.settings`](#story-settings-shape) shape — chapter threshold,
auto-close, recent buffer, compaction detail, translation block,
composer prefs, suggestions toggle. On story creation these copy
into the new `stories.settings`; the story owns its values
thereafter. Definitional fields (those in `stories.definition` —
`mode`, `leadEntityId`, `narration`, `genre`, `tone`, `setting`,
`calendarSystemId`, `worldTimeOrigin`) are absent from this default
shape — they're wizard-authored per story with no global default.

**Default calendar pointer.**

```ts
app_settings.default_calendar_id: string      // seeds new stories' calendarSystemId
```

A single-id pointer into the merged calendar registry. Calendar
definitions themselves live in [`vault_calendars`](#vault-content-storage)
(user-authored) + code (built-ins) — Vault content storage is
documented in its own decision section below.

**Why one table, not several.** Providers, profiles, and
assignments form one tightly-coupled config envelope — they're
edited together, deleted together (uninstall = drop the row), and
queried together at app open. Splitting into per-domain tables
would mean three INSERTs / three loads / three sync points for
zero query benefit (no JOIN ever runs against this data — it's
loaded once into Zustand at boot).

**Encryption at rest — deferred.** API keys live unencrypted in
the `providers[].apiKey` JSON. v1 is local-first with no network
exposure of the DB; the threat model that justifies encryption
hasn't materialized. Tracked in
[followups.md](./parked.md#encryption-at-rest-for-provider-keys).

### Vault content storage

**Decided:** non-story user content (calendars, future packs,
scenarios, character templates) lives in **per-type top-level
tables** prefixed with `vault_` — `vault_calendars` ships in v1;
`vault_packs`, `vault_scenarios`, `vault_character_templates` etc.
land when those features ship. Vault is the unified UI surface that
will browse and edit these in one place; storage stays per-type.

**`vault_calendars`** holds user-authored CalendarSystem definitions
(clones of built-ins, plus from-scratch entries when L3 lands).
Built-ins continue to live in code (or repo JSON loaded at boot)
and are merged with `vault_calendars` rows into one in-memory
`Map<id, CalendarSystem>` at app init. Stories reference calendars
by id; resolver does direct lookup against the merged registry.
Built-in ids (`'earth-gregorian'`) are stable strings; clone ids are
UUIDs — disjoint by construction, no precedence rule needed.

`app_settings.default_calendar_id` is a single-id pointer into the
merged registry — parallel to `default_provider_id`. The pointer
stays on `app_settings` since it's a global default, not registry
content.

**Favorite is a per-row flag** on `vault_calendars`, not a separate
app-level array. Surfaced as a `★`/`☆` toggle on Vault cards and
calendar pickers; sorts favorited rows above non-favorited ones.
Built-ins live in code so they have no row to carry the flag —
favoriting a built-in requires cloning it first (the resulting
`vault_calendars` row is the favoritable artifact). Acceptable
constraint: the workflow that prompts a "I want this favorited" is
also the workflow that prompts "I want to tweak its label or
displayFormat," so the clone step has independent value.

**Cloning a built-in** copies its definition to a new
`vault_calendars` row with a new UUID and the original preset name
copied verbatim. The `built-in` / `custom` chip in the editor UI
is the type indicator — no suffix is baked into the name. The
original built-in is never mutated; the clone is fully independent
from creation onward.

**Vault content deletion** is blocked when any story references the
content's id; otherwise allowed. Calendars set this stricter
precedent in v1; provider/profile deletion semantics — currently
softer — are revisited separately per
[`followups.md`](./followups.md#provider--profile--model-profile-deletion-semantics).

**Why per-type, not polymorphic.** Future Vault content types have
unrelated schemas — packs hold prompt template strings + variables,
scenarios are whatever shape lands, character templates are a
subset of entity state. Forcing them through one row shape
(`vault_items` with `kind` discriminator + JSON body) is premature
with only one type in flight. The unification question earns its
weight when ≥2 content types ship and we can validate against
actual schema overlap. Tracked in
[`followups.md`](./parked.md#vault-content-storage-pattern).

**Vault UI** is deferred per [`ui/README.md`](./ui/README.md); v1
surfaces the calendar editor as the first sub-wireframe under a
Vault parent (placeholder shell), with the broader Vault
navigation landing later.

### Entry metadata shape

**Decided:** `story_entries.metadata` is the per-entry JSON blob for
structured classifier/pipeline output alongside the raw `content`.
Distinct from `content` because it's structured, typed, and
delta-logged. Shape:

```ts
story_entries.metadata: {
  // Generation provenance (AI entries only)
  tokens?: { prompt: number, completion: number, reasoning?: number }
  model?: string
  generationTimingMs?: number
  reasoning?: string                // persisted reasoning text from providers that expose it; mirrors `tokens.reasoning` (the count). Optional — undefined when the provider doesn't surface reasoning.

  // Scene presence — classifier-authored
  sceneEntities: string[]           // entity IDs present in this entry's scene (characters + items)
  currentLocationId: string | null  // location entity that IS the current scene; singleton

  // In-world time — classifier-authored, user-editable
  worldTime: number                 // physical seconds since story start; calendar-uniform; monotonically non-decreasing within a branch
}
```

**Reasoning text persistence.** `reasoning` is written at stream
completion alongside `tokens.reasoning`. Field stays undefined for
providers that don't expose reasoning text. Translation behavior:
stays untranslated (provenance, not user-facing narrative — same
treatment as `model`). Read sites: the
[EntryCard pattern](./ui/patterns/entry-card.md#reasoning-expansion)
expands the brain-toggle reasoning body from this field;
export/backup includes it as part of the entry record. Search
scope intentionally excludes it (provenance, not searchable
narrative content).

**Scene presence is kind-aware.** `sceneEntities` carries characters
and items — the things that come and go. `currentLocationId` is the
singleton "we are here" pointer. Factions are not scene-tagged; a
faction isn't in a scene the way a person is.

**Metadata edits are delta-logged.** Unlike `content` (the single
per-column side-channel exemption, see "Entry mutability & rollback"),
metadata mutations write a delta. Consequence: a user correcting
`worldTime` on an entry after the classifier over-advanced during a
flashback produces a reversible delta, reachable via CTRL-Z or
rollback. Same for `sceneEntities` / `currentLocationId` user-edits.

### Opening entry

**Decided:** the opening of a story is `story_entries[1]` of the
initial branch — a first-class narrative entry, not a settings
field. Adds a new value to the `story_entries.kind` enum:

```ts
story_entries.kind:
  'user_action' | 'ai_reply' | 'system' | 'opening'  // NEW: 'opening'
```

**Authorship discriminator: `metadata.model`.** Set when the wizard's
AI-assist path generated the opening; `null` when the user wrote it
themselves. No separate `authorSource` field needed — model presence
is the discriminator.

**AI-generated openings emit minimal classification inline.** The
wizard's opening-generation call uses structured output to produce
prose AND minimal scene metadata in one call:

```ts
{
  prose: string,
  sceneEntities: string[],          // subset of wizard-curated cast entity ids
  currentLocationId: string | null, // one of the wizard-curated cast location ids
  worldTime: 0                      // story start; always 0
}
```

The model is constrained to reference only the wizard-curated cast
in the metadata refs (passed as enum-shaped reference data in the
generation context). Prose can mention unbacked names freely
("Old Jorin was sleeping at the bar") — only the metadata refs are
constrained.

**No separate classifier pass on the opening (v1).** User-written
openings start with empty metadata (`worldTime: 0`,
`sceneEntities: []`, `currentLocationId: null`); turn 2's classifier
populates scene presence going forward. The first AI reply's prompt
context includes the opening prose verbatim (recent buffer covers
it), so the AI grounds itself from prose regardless of metadata
state. A separate tagging pass for user-written openings is parked
in
[`followups.md → Classifier-on-opening retrofit`](./parked.md#classifier-on-opening-retrofit).

**Opening invariants** (enforced at the action layer):

- **Position invariant.** Always position 1 of its branch. Action
  layer rejects any write that would create or move an `opening`
  entry to a different position.
- **Block-delete.** `op=delete` on `kind='opening'` is rejected at
  the action layer. Use cases for "redo the opening" are addressed
  by text-edit (the existing side-channel exemption — see "Entry
  mutability & rollback") or by a wizard-driven regenerate pass
  (parked in
  [`parked.md → Regenerate-opening affordance — post-commit from reader chrome`](./parked.md#regenerate-opening-affordance--post-commit-from-reader-chrome)).
- **Branching:** copies forward via the standard branch-copy
  mechanism — the opening behaves like any entry being copied into
  the new branch.
- **Rollback:** can target entry 1 (which leaves only the opening);
  can never go below the opening.

**Reader rendering** is identical to `ai_reply` bubbles — narrative
prose is narrative prose, regardless of authorship. Provenance lives
in metadata, not in styling. No regen icon, no model-name label;
delete is suppressed by the block-delete invariant.

### In-world time tracking

**Decided:** time is modeled as a single monotonically non-decreasing
integer `worldTime` on each entry's metadata, in **physical seconds
since story start**. The base unit is universal — every calendar uses
the same physical-seconds integer. The calendar's role is to map that
integer to its tier-tuple via a `secondsPerBaseUnit` anchor (1 for
Earth, 86400 for Shire's day-grain, 86400 for Mayan kin) plus its
tier rollover stack. See [`calendar-systems/spec.md`](./calendar-systems/spec.md)
for the calendar primitive.

`stories.definition.worldTimeOrigin: TierTuple` — a `Record<string,
number>` keyed by the active calendar's tier names — anchors
`worldTime = 0` to a display moment. Earth's origin is `{ year,
month, day, hour, minute, second }`; Shire's is `{ year, month,
day }`; Stardate's is `{ count }`. Calendar-uniform from v1; no
string-to-tuple migration ever needs to run. Any "creation date
string" UI need is met by rendering the tuple through the calendar's
`displayFormat` template.

**Why universal seconds.** Calendar-specific base units would force
the integer to reinterpret on calendar swap (Earth-86400 = 1 day;
Shire-86400 = 86400 days) and would force per-calendar
classifier-prompt math. Universal seconds keeps the integer
genuinely calendar-agnostic — preserved across swap, classifier
always emits second-deltas, all worldTime arithmetic uniform across
calendars. The precision floor is one second (sub-second narrative
isn't a thing for fiction); int64 holds ~290 billion years.

**Why integer-based.** Free-form "time label" strings ("Day 3,
evening") can't be math'd. Future features (character ageing,
scheduled happenings firing on time, freshness-based retrieval decay)
all want arithmetic. A raw elapsed counter gives us that; the calendar
formatter produces the human-readable string on render.

**Why story-relative, not absolute unix.** Story-relative keeps the
classifier's job tractable — "how many seconds elapsed this turn" is
the question it can actually answer. Absolute unix would require the
classifier to know the setting's calendar from turn 1, and would be
incoherent for fictional worlds against an implicit 1970 epoch.

**Classifier contract.** Each AI reply's classification pass estimates
elapsed seconds and emits a delta for the new entry's
`metadata.worldTime`. The active calendar's vocabulary (tier names,
weekday labels, era names) ships into the classifier's prompt context
so it can convert prose like "two days later" or "next Tuesday" — but
its arithmetic output is always in seconds, regardless of calendar.
For detected flashback/memory framing ("she remembered...", "25 years
earlier..."), the classifier emits `0` — main-timeline clock doesn't
advance during recalled scenes. Estimation errors are unavoidable;
users can manually edit `metadata.worldTime` (delta-logged like any
metadata mutation) to correct drift.

**v1 limitation — non-linear narrative.** Single-`worldTime` cleanly
models linear narrative plus short flashbacks (main clock just
doesn't advance during memory). It does NOT model structural non-
linear narratives (alternating timelines, time travel, parallel
chronologies). In those stories, happenings classified during an
"alternate timeline" chunk inherit the entry's `worldTime` which
reflects render-order rather than in-world order; the knowledge
graph gets fuzzy in those regions. Chapter titles and prose carry
the disambiguation.

Future exit, if demand emerges: add optional `sceneTime: number | null`
to `story_entries.metadata` — null = "same as worldTime," non-null =
"this entry depicts a scene at this historical time." Awareness and
happening logic would consult `sceneTime` when present. Since
metadata is a JSON blob, adding the field later is zero
schema-migration cost; no reason to reserve it now.

**`happenings.temporal` stays free-form.** Out-of-narrative events
("ongoing", "next solstice", "1872 AR") don't math cleanly and exist
as display annotations, not clock values. The burden of matching
temporal strings to the story's calendar rests with the user.

### Era flips

**Decided:** era flips (per [calendar-systems/spec.md → Eras](./calendar-systems/spec.md#eras-hoisted-out-manually-triggered))
live in a dedicated branch-scoped table `branch_era_flips`. Each row
is one user-triggered "Flip era" action: `at_worldtime` (in physical
seconds, taken from the entry's `metadata.worldTime` at trigger time)

- `era_name` (user-chosen or picked from
  `EraDeclaration.presetNames`).

**Why a table, not JSON on `branches`.** Era flips fork with
branches like every other narrative state. Storing them as a JSON
column on `branches` would force adding `branches` to
`deltas.target_table` (currently never delta-logged), break the
"branches is config-shaped, narrative state in dedicated tables"
pattern, and turn per-flip mutations into whole-row JSON updates
with awkward delta payloads. The dedicated table inherits the
standard composite-PK + snapshot-on-fork + per-row delta machinery;
CTRL-Z on a flip reverses one tiny `op=create` delta.

**Why not piggy-back on `happenings`.** Era flips are calendar
configuration events, not narrative events. They don't have
involvements or awareness; the conflation would muddy both domains.

**Constraints:**

- `at_worldtime ≥ 0` — no pre-story flips. Pre-story history belongs
  in `happenings.temporal`. Time is increment-only.
- Unique `(branch_id, at_worldtime)` — no two flips at the same
  moment on the same branch. UI-level invariant; the user has no
  normal flow to construct conflicting writes.
- A flip at `at_worldtime = 0` overrides the calendar's
  `EraDeclaration.defaultStartName`. The story-creation wizard
  (deferred — not yet drawn; lands with the wizard pass) is the
  intended surface for picking the initial era at story creation;
  if it ships an era-picker that produces a non-default choice, it
  writes a flip at 0. Until the wizard exists, new stories
  inherit `defaultStartName` and the user's first explicit flip is
  whatever they trigger from the reader chrome.

**Resolver convention.** "Active era at worldTime N" = the row with
the largest `at_worldtime ≤ N` for the current branch. Before any
flip (and the calendar isn't constrained to have one at 0), the
active era is the calendar's `EraDeclaration.defaultStartName`.
Indexable on `(branch_id, at_worldtime)` for O(log n) lookup.

**Calendar swap.** Flips are preserved as-is (`at_worldtime` is in
seconds, calendar-agnostic). If the new calendar has `eras: null`,
the flips become orphaned data — display ignores them, but they're
not deleted; re-enabling era support later re-surfaces them. The
swap UX warns about this case.

### Injection modes — unified enum + structural invariant

**Decided:** `lore`, `entities`, and `threads` all carry an
`injection_mode` column with the same enum:
`always | auto | disabled`.

- `always` — include in every prompt render unconditionally.
- `auto` — let the retrieval pipeline decide via keyword + embedding
  - LLM-fallback. **Default** for new rows. See
    [docs/memory/retrieval.md → Hybrid retrieval per type](./memory/retrieval.md#hybrid-retrieval-per-type).
- `disabled` — never include automatically; only surfaces if
  explicitly referenced.

**Naming history.** `lore.injection_mode` was originally
`always | keyword | manual`; a renaming pass changed it to
`always | keyword_llm | disabled`. The current `auto` rename
collapses the keyword-vs-LLM distinction — retrieval handles both
under the hood (keyword + embedding + LLM-fallback when both miss),
so the user-facing knob doesn't need to expose the implementation
detail. Schema migration: rename enum value across `entities`,
`lore`, `threads`.

**`happenings` deliberately do not carry `injection_mode`.** The
awareness graph (`happening_awareness`) is the injection rule —
structural, not user-toggled. A happening is injected because a POV
character knows about it (per the awareness link, ranked by
`decay_resistance` and `sim_blend`), not because the user set a
mode.

**Structural invariant — active + in-scene entities always
injected.** Regardless of an entity's `injection_mode` setting,
entities with `status='active'` AND presence in the current entry's
`sceneEntities` are ALWAYS injected. The retrieval phase
short-circuits the mode check for this case. Rationale: an active
in-scene entity IS what the current narrative is about; excluding
it on a user-set `disabled` flag would produce broken prompts. The
mode setting is consulted only for entities that are NOT
structurally required — staged, retired, or active-but-off-scene.
Same invariant applies to active threads (must-inject) and to
`injection_mode='always'` rows. See
[docs/memory/retrieval.md → Candidate pools](./memory/retrieval.md#candidate-pools)
for the full structural-floor contract.

### Entry mutability & rollback

**Decided:** everything is an event in the append-only `deltas` log,
regardless of who authored the change — AI classifier, lore-management
agent, memory compaction pass, chapter close, or direct user edit.
Rollback = reverse every delta with `log_position ≥ N`. Entity rows
(and lore / thread / happening / chapter rows) are mutated in place for
fast reads; the delta log is the history of record.

User editing an entry's text does **not** auto-trigger re-classification.
Text edits are separate from state edits; state stays put unless the user
explicitly re-classifies, which appends new deltas at the log head rather
than rewriting history. This keeps the log linear and append-only under
arbitrary editing.

**Text edits are a side-channel, not in the delta log.** Editing
`story_entries.content` mutates the row directly without producing a
delta. Consequences:

- Rollback to entry M still works — entries past M are hard-deleted
  regardless of whether their text was user-edited.
- There is no log-based "undo my text edit" — the original AI output
  isn't preserved. If the user wants editor-local undo for typo-level
  tweaks, that's the editor's responsibility (a transient in-editor
  undo stack), not rollback's.
- When branching from entry N, the new branch copies entry N's _current_
  text (edited or not). The edit propagates through the fork, which is
  the intended behaviour — text edits are user intent, not narrative
  state that needs reversing.

**Wizard creation is exempt from the delta log.** The wizard's commit
transaction writes the `stories` row, the initial `branches` row, the
initial cast (`entities` rows), the world rules (`lore` rows), and
the opening (`story_entries[1]`, kind=`opening`) — all in one atomic
SQLite transaction, **no deltas written**. They are baked in as the
story's initial state. Implications:

- Earliest possible delta in the log is the user's first turn (a
  `user_action` create on the initial branch).
- CTRL-Z in a freshly-wizard-created story is a no-op until the user
  takes a turn (no delta exists to reverse).
- Rollback can target entry 1 (leaves only the opening) but can never
  go below — there's nothing below the opening to roll back to.
- Branching from the opening copies wizard-created rows + the (empty)
  delta log up to that point — clean handoff with no special-case
  branch-copy logic needed.

Subsequent edits to wizard-created rows (text edits on the opening,
field edits on initial entities, body edits on initial lore) follow
**normal delta semantics** — only the wizard's _creation_ is exempt;
update / delete operations on those rows produce deltas as usual.
This is the second delta-scope exemption alongside the
`story_entries.content` text-edit side-channel above; together they
are the only narrative-state mutations that bypass the log.

**Delta storage economy.** Each delta stores only **undo** information in
a single `undo_payload` column — no redundant "after" snapshot, since the
live row already holds that. For `op=create` the payload is null (undo =
delete target_id). For `op=update` it's a partial diff of only the fields
that changed, with their pre-change values. For `op=delete` it's the full
row JSON (needed to re-insert). This collapses storage by ~6-7x compared
to storing full before+after snapshots, and prevents large state fields
like portraits from polluting every unrelated update.

**Delta scope: narrative state only.** Deltas cover the core narrative
tables (`story_entries` row-level changes, `entities` narrative fields,
`lore`, `threads`, `happenings` and their links, `chapters`, `entry_assets`).
UI-only fields (`favorite`, `sort_order`, `ui_color`, etc.) bypass the log
— rollback doesn't revert them, because they aren't story content. The
write layer enforces this distinction: mutations to narrative fields
write a delta + row update in one transaction; mutations to UI fields
just update the row.

**Exception on `story_entries.content`.** The text content of an entry
is the one narrative field deliberately exempted from the delta log
(per the side-channel decision above). Row-level changes to
`story_entries` (creates when an AI reply or user action is added,
`chapter_id` assignment at chapter close, row deletes when a user
manually removes an entry) ARE logged. In-place text edits are NOT.
This is the only per-column exemption inside a delta-scoped table.

**Audit/debug reconstruction** (of "what did delta N do?") comes from
forward-replay against earliest state or comparison to the current live
row. The on-disk delta is lean at the cost of one layer of indirection
for audit tooling. Acceptable trade.

**Log compaction and payload compression** are deferred. Compaction
(collapsing old update chains into coarser snapshots) would trade
fine-grained deep-rollback for storage. Gzipping `undo_payload` is cheap
but makes raw-DB debugging painful. Revisit only if storage becomes a
real concern — current ceiling (~5MB deltas per large story) is fine.

**User-facing undo (CTRL-Z) is built on top of the delta log.** Every
delta carries an `action_id` that groups it with other deltas produced
by the same user-visible operation. Action boundaries:

- **User direct edit** — one delta, one fresh `action_id`. CTRL-Z
  reverses that single delta.
- **AI reply** — the `story_entries` create delta plus all
  classifier-produced deltas share one `action_id`. CTRL-Z reverses the
  whole batch uniformly — the story_entries row is deleted as the
  reversal of its `op=create` delta, no special case needed.
- **Chapter close** — the chapter row insert + `story_entries.chapter_id`
  updates across the range + lore-agent writes + memory-compaction
  writes all share one `action_id`. CTRL-Z collapses the entire batch
  as a single unit, because a user who clicks "undo" expects the whole
  "the chapter closed" event to disappear in one press.

Algorithm:

1. Find the head delta (max `log_position` on current branch)
2. Collect every delta with the same `action_id`
3. Reverse them (newest to oldest) exactly as rollback does
4. Move the reversed deltas onto an in-memory redo stack (not persisted)
5. Remove them from the `deltas` table

Redo re-applies from the in-memory stack. The stack clears on any new
action. Redo is runtime-only; no schema support needed. If the app
restarts, redo history is lost (acceptable — this matches editor
conventions).

This co-exists cleanly with entry-level rollback: CTRL-Z is
action-granular ("undo my last thing"), rollback is entry-granular
("take me back to entry 40"). Both use the same reverse-delta mechanism.

### Happenings & character knowledge

**Decided:** plot-progression-as-monolithic-table (the old `story_beats`)
is split into two layers with clean responsibilities:

- **`happenings`** — the atomic unit of "what occurred / exists as a
  knowable fact." Covers scene events during play, pre-story history,
  ongoing states, and scheduled/future happenings. Two link tables
  connect outward:
  - `happening_involvements` — which entities are the subject matter
    (character, location, item, faction; optional free-form `role` label).
  - `happening_awareness` — which characters know about it, with
    `learned_at_entry`, `decay_resistance` (per-character pin signal,
    set by classifier severity at extraction; tunable by user toggle
    and lore-mgmt at chapter close — see
    [docs/memory/retrieval.md → Pinning](./memory/retrieval.md#pinning--decay_resistance)),
    `retrieval_count` (delta-logged operational counter the ranker
    increments on injection; drives the high-frequency review at
    chapter-close phase 3d), and a free-form `source` descriptor
    ("overheard in tavern" / "told by Jorin" / "witnessed firsthand")
    that the LLM authors and we use verbatim in prompts. No `relation`
    enum — the source text carries that information more expressively,
    and the LLM wants to write it in natural language anyway. This
    **is** character memory — no separate memory table. "What does
    Aria know?" is just a query against awareness links where
    `character_id = Aria`. Happenings with `common_knowledge=1` skip
    awareness links entirely (no need to write N identical rows for
    "everyone knows the king is dead"). A
    `UNIQUE(branch_id, character_id, happening_id)` constraint ensures
    upsert semantics in the classifier and user-edit paths — duplicate
    awareness rows can't accumulate at the DB level.

    Old `salience REAL` field was dropped — replaced by the
    `sim_blend × recency_factor` model in the retrieval ranker, where
    `recency_factor` integrates `decay_resistance` for the ageing
    story. Old salience was content-blind; the new model is
    content-aware (`sim_blend` recomputes per turn against the current
    scene). See
    [docs/memory/retrieval.md → The ranker](./memory/retrieval.md#the-ranker).

- **`threads`** — the broader view: quest tracker, overarching arcs,
  ambient plot pressures. Freeform `category` + `icon` (string key from a
  preset catalog). Statuses: `pending | active | resolved | failed`.
  Resolved means "done successfully / achieved"; failed is distinct because
  lumping them together loses useful information.

This shape solves the character-omniscience problem (story knowledge ≠
character knowledge; awareness links are the filter) and addresses the
events-vs-beats name collision (events are happenings now; threads don't
have an enum kind anymore).

**On the two time fields on `happenings`:** `occurred_at_entry` and
`temporal` look overlapping but measure orthogonal axes. `occurred_at_entry`
is the narrative log position — present for happenings that occurred
during play, used for rollback ordering and scene-based retrieval. The
actual in-world time for a narrative happening is **derived** from the
referenced entry's `metadata.worldTime` (see "Entry metadata shape" and
"In-world time tracking" below). No duplication on `happenings`.
`temporal` is only populated when there is no narrative entry to
derive from (pre-story history, scheduled future, ambient backdrop) —
its free-form text is the anchor because out-of-narrative happenings
have no cumulative counter to reference. `occurred_at_entry`
and `temporal` are **mutually exclusive per row**, enforced both
at the SQLite level (CHECK constraint at table-create time:
`CHECK (occurred_at_entry IS NULL OR temporal IS NULL)`) and at
the Zod boundary on form/import. The DB constraint is the floor;
the Zod check is the friendlier validation surface. `threads` don't carry
`temporal` because threads only exist during narrative and always
resolve via entry positions (same worldTime-derivation story as
happenings).

**Context-bloat note:** for long-running stories, character awareness
lists grow unbounded — projected scale is thousands of happenings and
tens of thousands of awareness rows on a 30+ chapter story per
[docs/memory/retrieval.md → Scale assumptions](./memory/retrieval.md#scale-assumptions).
This is handled at injection time (per-type budgets with hard
partitions, top-200 pre-filter, MMR-diverse selection,
`sim_blend × recency_factor + kw_boost` scoring with high-similarity
bypass for revival of decayed memories) and by chapter-close lore-mgmt
(awareness pin tuning, happenings consolidation). Schema is mostly
unchanged from the bloat angle; the storage profile remains workable
at v1's projected volumes.

### Translation

**Decided:** translation of LLM-generated user-facing content (narrative,
user action text, entity names/descriptions, lore bodies, thread titles,
happening descriptions — everything the LLM produces) is stored in a
dedicated `translations` table with a polymorphic target, rather than as
per-column `translated_*` fields on each source row.

Rationale: the old app spread `translated_name`, `translated_description`,
`translated_relationship`, etc. across every world-state table — column
proliferation that also hard-coded "one target language" and lost prior
translations if the user reconfigured. Dedicated table fixes all three.

**Definition fields are NOT translation targets.** The substantial
prose in `stories.definition` (`genre.promptBody` / `tone.promptBody`
/ `setting`) is user-typed source-language input consumed by the AI
during generation; it's not AI-output displayed in different UI
languages. The translations table targets AI-output content only —
not author-input fields.

**Shape:**

- `(branch_id, id)` composite PK (translations fork with branches like
  every other branch-scoped table)
- `target_kind` + `target_id` = polymorphic FK (same convention as
  `deltas.target_table` / `target_id`)
- `field` names the translated field on the source row. Supports nested
  paths (e.g. `state.condition` on entities) for kind-specific state JSON
- `language` is an ISO 639-1 code; multiple target languages coexist
- UNIQUE(branch_id, target_kind, target_id, field, language) prevents
  duplicate translations per (source field, language)

**Deltas participate.** `deltas.target_table` includes `translations`.
Translation writes produce deltas under the same `action_id` as the
originating action — so if the classifier creates a new entity that
triggers a translation write, a single CTRL-Z reverses both the entity
and its translation.

**Runtime:** Zustand loads translations into an index
`Map<(kind, id, field, lang), string>` for O(1) render-time lookup. UI
renders translated text when a translation exists for the current
language + field, else falls back to the source. Pipeline translation
phase writes translation rows via Zustand actions, same pattern as
every other state mutation.

**Scope reminder:** this table handles LLM-authored content only.
Translation of the app's own UI strings (menus, buttons, settings) is a
separate concern — handled by `i18next` at the UI layer, backed by
`locales/*.json` files in the repo.

### Chapters / memory system

**Decided:** chapters are first-class, per-branch, user-visible. They
segment the narrative into named, summarized ranges and provide the
cadence trigger for the chapter-close pipeline.

This section captures the storage / atomic-commit contract; the
pipeline phases, lore-mgmt sub-jobs, and memory architecture more
broadly are designed in [`docs/memory/`](./memory/README.md).

**Open chapter has no row.** Only closed chapters are persisted as
`chapters` rows. Entries in the "open region" (after the latest
closed chapter's end) simply have `chapter_id IS NULL` until a
chapter is created that includes them.

**Boundary trigger.** Per-story token threshold
(`stories.settings.chapterTokenThreshold`, default 24k, user-
configurable). When the open region's accumulated token count crosses
the threshold AND `stories.settings.chapterAutoClose=true`, the
chapter-close pipeline fires. With `chapterAutoClose=false`, the UI
shows a "ready to close" indicator but doesn't auto-fire. User can
also manually trigger chapter-create at any time, picking the ending
entry explicitly.

**Chapter-close is the single cadence trigger** for the 5-phase
pipeline (catch-up classifier, boundary selection, chapter metadata,
lore management with five sub-jobs, lifecycle review). All five
phases share one `action_id` so a single CTRL-Z reverses the entire
chapter-close. See
[docs/memory/chapter-close.md](./memory/chapter-close.md) for the
full pipeline design.

**Chapter summaries become a retrieval candidate pool.** Closed
`chapters` rows feed the chapter-summaries retrieval pool — each
chapter's `summary` (plus `theme` and `keywords`) is embeddable and
ranks against the per-turn query stack. Matched chapters also boost
happenings within their range (chapter-match boost). See
[docs/memory/retrieval.md → Candidate pools](./memory/retrieval.md#candidate-pools).

**Per-branch, forks cleanly.** Each branch has its own `chapters`
rows with its own IDs. On branch creation, chapter rows (and all
other state) are copied to the new branch up to the fork point.
Edits to a chapter's title or summary on one branch don't leak to
siblings. If the fork point is inside what would have been a closed
chapter on the parent, the new branch simply never sees that
chapter's closure events — those deltas happened after the fork
point and aren't copied.

**No chapter-boundary restrictions on rollback or branching** — see
Branch model above. Chapters are user-visible structure, not
gatekeepers.

### Backup & export format

**Decided:** two separate, single-purpose operations. No zip bundling.

1. **Full backup** — produces a `.sqlite` snapshot via `VACUUM INTO`,
   plus a failsafe JSON dump of each story bundled alongside (same file
   or adjacent — packaging shape parked, see
   [`parked.md → Backup / export packaging shape`](./parked.md#backup--export-packaging-shape)).
   Intended for full-app restore. Also copies the assets directory
   since media lives on disk, not in SQLite.

2. **Per-story export** — produces a single self-contained `.avts`
   file for one story: all its branches, entries, entities, lore,
   threads, happenings + links, chapters, deltas, and entry→asset
   references. Binary assets are embedded as base64 or sidecar files
   (packaging shape parked, see
   [`parked.md → Backup / export packaging shape`](./parked.md#backup--export-packaging-shape)).
   Wrapped in the standard
   [Aventuras file envelope](#aventuras-file-format-avts) for
   version-tagged imports. Intended for sharing / archiving /
   migration.

The two have genuinely different purposes and the old app's conflation
into a single zip produced friction — users invoking "backup" got a
story export they didn't want, and vice versa. Split avoids that.

### Aventuras file format (`.avts`)

**Decided:** `.avts` is the canonical extension for all
Aventuras-flavored import/export content. Every supported content
type — stories, calendars, future packs / scenarios / templates —
serializes as a JSON envelope with a stable header. Same extension
across all kinds; the `format` field inside identifies what the file
contains.

**Envelope shape:**

```json
{
  "format": "aventuras-<kind>",
  "formatVersion": "<major>.<minor>",
  "exportedAt": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
  "<kind>": {
    /* the content payload */
  }
}
```

The content key matches the kind (`story` for `aventuras-story`,
`calendar` for `aventuras-calendar`, etc.) — readable both
machine-side and to a human inspecting the JSON.

**Kinds shipped in v1:**

| `format`             | Content                                  | Defined by                                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `aventuras-story`    | Single story (branches, entries, world…) | [Per-story export](#backup--export-format)             |
| `aventuras-calendar` | Single CalendarSystem definition         | [calendar-systems/spec.md](./calendar-systems/spec.md) |

Future kinds (`aventuras-pack`, `aventuras-scenario`, etc.) follow
the same envelope as those features ship.

**Version handling.** `formatVersion` is the load-bearing
compatibility signal. Major bumps signal a hard break; minor bumps
are additive. Importers compare against currently supported versions
and fail clearly:

- File's major < importer-supported → "This file is from an older
  version of Aventuras."
- File's major > importer-supported → "This file is from a newer
  version. Update Aventuras to import."
- Minor mismatches accepted as long as major matches; minor-newer
  fields validated against the schema and ignored if zod doesn't
  recognize them (forward-compatible by zod's default).

**Two import surfaces:**

1. **Per-UI gated** (default in v1). Each surface accepts only its
   matching kind — the Vault calendar editor's `From JSON file…`
   rejects anything that isn't `aventuras-calendar`; story-list's
   `+ Import story` rejects anything that isn't `aventuras-story`.
   Contextual safety: you can't accidentally import a calendar into
   a story slot.
2. **Universal import** (deferred — see
   [followups.md](./parked.md#universal-import-surface)). One
   dispatcher accepts any `.avts`, reads the `format` field, and
   routes to the matching creation flow. Useful for "I have this
   file, just import it." Not blocking v1; per-UI gated covers the
   common cases.

**Legacy `.avt` import** (from the old app) is a separate migration
path with its own format handling, tracked in
[`followups.md`](./parked.md#legacy-avt-migration-import). Not
part of this convention.

**Extension policy.** `.avts` is canonical; UI file pickers
default-filter to it. `.json` is also accepted as input (same
envelope content, different extension) for users who hand-author or
import files from non-Aventuras sources. Output writes always
produce `.avts`.

### Assets (images & future media)

**Decided:** binary assets live **externally on disk**, not as SQLite BLOBs. The DB holds only
metadata (`file_path`, `mime_type`, `size_bytes`, `content_hash`).
Change from the old app, which embedded image data as data-URLs in the
DB — that bloated SQLite files and slowed VACUUM.

**Shared across branches via reference.** The `entry_assets` link table
binds an entry to one or more asset rows. On branch creation, `entry_assets`
rows are copied (tiny), but `assets` rows are NOT — both branches point
at the same asset IDs. This is what keeps the hard-fork branching model
operationally cheap despite image-heavy stories.

**Assets are story/branch-agnostic.** Content-hash keying means identical
content naturally dedups. No benefit to scoping tighter.

**Cleanup on delete.** When an `entry_assets` row is removed (rollback,
branch deletion, entry deletion), check if the referenced asset has any
remaining `entry_assets` rows. If none, delete the `assets` row AND the
file on disk. Immediate cleanup, no orphan-GC job needed.
