# Aventuras — memory

How memory works in the app: keeping prose and structured world state
consistent turn by turn, surfacing older content when relevant, and
assembling the per-turn generation context.

[`data-model.md`](../data-model.md) says what's stored;
[`architecture.md`](../architecture.md) says how the pipeline runs
end-to-end. This folder says how those tables stay consistent with
the prose, what gets injected into each generation call, and how
older content ranks against the current scene.

Living docs. Many decisions in here landed across one long design
session; rationale alongside the choice where useful.

## What this doc owns

"Memory" in this app is overloaded across distinct concepts:

- **Per-turn scene metadata** — who is in the scene, where, when.
- **In-context retrieval** — what beyond the structural floor gets
  injected each call.
- **Long-term character knowledge** — `happening_awareness` rows and
  how they persist or decay.
- **Slow-evolving identity** — `traits` / `drives` / `agenda` arrays
  on entity state.
- **Procedural memory** — the delta log itself (rollback path).

This folder owns the **pipeline** between them: cadence (when does
each agent run), retrieval (how is per-turn context assembled), and
the contract each layer holds with the others. Storage tables stay
canonical in [`data-model.md`](../data-model.md). UI affordances for
user-facing knobs sit with the relevant Story Settings / App Settings
screens.

## Doc tree

The design splits across topic files. Read in this order for a
linear walk; each file is self-contained for reference once you know
the shape.

- **[cadence.md](./cadence.md)** — three-layer cadence model
  (piggyback / periodic classifier / chapter-close), why each layer,
  user-tunable knobs (`recentBuffer` / `fullChapterInBuffer` /
  `classifierCadence`), concurrency contract.
- **[piggyback.md](./piggyback.md)** — per-turn writes contract:
  trailing tagged block, computed bookkeeping, jsonrepair fallback,
  capability gate, mode-mixing across a story.
- **[classifier.md](./classifier.md)** — periodic classifier
  contract: write set, disambiguation on new-character mentions,
  background-task framing.
- **[chapter-close.md](./chapter-close.md)** — 5-phase chapter-close
  pipeline: catch-up, boundary selection, metadata, lore-mgmt
  (5 sub-jobs), lifecycle review, failure modes, manual close.
- **[retrieval.md](./retrieval.md)** — embedding infrastructure,
  query construction, candidate pools, hybrid retrieval per type,
  pinning (`decay_resistance`), per-type budgets, the ranker
  (scoring + MMR + budget-fill + bypass + chapter-match boost).
- **[model-management.md](./model-management.md)** — embedding
  model lifecycle: curated catalog, onboarding, on-disk layout,
  download flow, license attestation, removal, init-failure
  handling, staleness UI.
- **[edge-cases.md](./edge-cases.md)** — name collision +
  disambiguation, staged-entity promotion, retirement, cutaway /
  multi-scene entries, v1 limitations.
- **[probe.md](./probe.md)** — memory probe contract: per-turn
  capture model (light default, deep opt-in), simulator math
  (re-rank captured state under edited params), FIFO eviction at
  100 captures/story, cross-cuts for branch fork / model swap /
  failure capture / param drift. Embedding-mode only. Screen UX
  in
  [`docs/ui/screens/memory-probe/memory-probe.md`](../ui/screens/memory-probe/memory-probe.md).

Memory-pipeline deferrals live in the top-level
[`parked.md → Memory pipeline (parked)`](../parked.md#memory-pipeline-parked).
Calibration and implementation followups are inline in the
canonical docs above (retrieval.md, model-management.md, probe.md).
