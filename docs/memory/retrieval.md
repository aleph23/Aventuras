# Retrieval

Embeddings, queries, candidate pools, hybrid retrieval per type,
pinning, per-type budgets, and the ranker that turns it all into the
injected slice for each turn.

---

## Embedding infrastructure

### Runtime — provider OR local, user choice

User-pickable backend per story (or app-default), both producing the
same memory algorithm:

- **Provider embedding endpoint.** Self-hosted or cloud, depending on
  the user's configured provider. Anthropic doesn't expose
  embeddings; OpenAI, Voyage, Google do. The
  `app_settings.providers[].cachedModels[].capabilities` schema
  carries embedding capability per model.
- **Bundled local embedder.** A quantized small ONNX model
  (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or similar; selection lands at implementation),
  ~25MB bundle, ~384-dim, runs on CPU. Cross-platform via Electron on
  desktop and Expo on mobile.

The user picks one or the other in App Settings → Memory; both drive
identical retrieval behavior. The choice affects only the embedding
model, not the algorithm.

### Mode-3 fallback — story-creation regime

If a story is configured with neither a provider embedding nor the
local embedder available (or the user explicitly opts out), retrieval
degrades to **LLM-only mode** — a dedicated retrieval agent makes
per-turn LLM calls to pick what to inject from the candidate pool.
Slow, expensive, but works without embedding infrastructure.

Mode-3 is **set at story creation, no mid-story switching**. The two
regimes (embedding-driven vs. LLM-only) produce different memory
behavior — different cost-per-turn, different failure modes, different
retrieval-quality curve on long stories. Switching mid-story would
invalidate the prior memory model. The story remembers which mode it
ran in; the future memory-probe affordance (parked) becomes
load-bearing for debugging mode-3.

### Storage

The conceptual / logical shape is a polymorphic FK mirroring the
`translations` pattern:

```sql
embeddings {
  branch_id TEXT, id TEXT,                      -- composite PK; forks with branch
  target_kind TEXT,                             -- 'entity' | 'lore' | 'happening' | 'thread' | 'chapter'
  target_id TEXT,                               -- id in target_table
  field TEXT,                                   -- 'description' | 'body' | 'composite' | etc.
  model_id TEXT,                                -- canonical embedding model id; last model used (see below)
  dim INTEGER,                                  -- vector dimension
  vector BLOB,                                  -- packed float32 or float16
  source_hash TEXT,                             -- content hash of source fields at embed time
  updated_at INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY (branch_id, id),
  UNIQUE (branch_id, target_kind, target_id, field, model_id)
}
```

**Physical storage — per-type `vec0` virtual tables.** Production
uses one [`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) `vec0`
virtual table per target kind: `entities_vec`, `lore_vec`,
`happenings_vec`, `threads_vec`, `chapter_summaries_vec` — each
joined to its metadata sibling by id. The polymorphic schema above
is the logical view; vec0 doesn't filter efficiently across
mixed-type rows, so per-type physical layout is the production
shape. Validated in PoC; per-query KNN at ~11 / 43 / 61 / 122 ms at
1k / 10k / 50k / 100k rows on a flagship Android device.
`source_hash` placement (auxiliary vec0 column or per-type sidecar
metadata table) is a production-integration detail, not pinned here.

**Single active model only.** All vec0 rows are under whichever
embedding model the user has currently selected. On swap (per
[Model swap UX](#model-swap-ux)), vec0 tables drop and recreate.
The `model_id` column carries the model that produced each row —
by invariant the currently-active one — and serves as a label and
cache key, not as a multi-model coexistence mechanism. Mixed-model
retrieval is fundamentally broken (query and stored vectors must
share a vector space); v1 doesn't support it and there's no path
to add it without separate per-model indexes, which sqlite-vec
doesn't make cheap.

**Source-hash staleness detection.** Embeddings are not delta-
logged because they're deterministic from source content — re-
computing reproduces them losslessly. But the source field can
change without the embedding being aware (manual edit, rollback
reverting a prior edit, branch-fork drift, schema migration). The
fix is hash-based lazy detection at retrieval time:

- `source_hash` stores the content hash of the embedded fields at
  embed time (`xxhash(title + description)` or similar).
- At retrieval, compute the candidate row's current content hash;
  compare to the stored `source_hash`.
- **Mismatch → re-embed before scoring**, persist with the new
  `source_hash`.

Uniform: handles rollback-induced staleness, manual edits, schema
migrations, anything that desyncs row content from its embedding.
Cost is microseconds per candidate per turn (`xxhash` is fast); re-
embed only fires when actually needed.

**Why not timestamps for staleness detection.** Rollback restores
a prior `row.updated_at` along with the rest of the row's state. So
`row.updated_at < embedding.updated_at` post-rollback — the "row
newer than embedding" check inverts, staleness goes undetected.
Hashes are content-aware and immune to timeline-direction games.

Branched (forks with the branch like every other branch-scoped table).

### What gets embedded per type

| Type             | Field                                                | Stability                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity**       | `name + description`                                 | Stable; re-embed only on user edit of either          |
| **Lore**         | `title + body`                                       | Stable; re-embed on user edit                         |
| **Happening**    | `title + description`                                | Stable after creation; re-embed on user edit          |
| **Thread**       | `title + description`                                | Stable; re-embed on user edit                         |
| **Chapter**      | `summary + theme`                                    | Stable after Phase 2 generates; re-embed on user edit |
| **Scene digest** | composite of structural fields plus optional summary | Per-turn ephemeral; not stored                        |

**Entity state is excluded from embeddings.** `visual.*`,
`equipped_items`, etc. mutate per turn; including them in entity
embeddings would force per-turn re-embeds across the cast. State
mutations affect retrieval via the structural floor (active+in-scene
short-circuit) and via the entity's role in scene digests, not via the
entity embedding itself.

### Refresh / cadence

- **After turn:** embed everything the turn produced (new lore, new
  happenings, refreshed scene digest, edited descriptions). User is
  reading; idle window is ~5-30 seconds. Background-job-scheduled.
- **Before turn:** embed user action only. Short text; <20ms local,
  <100ms API.
- **Cache:** keyed by `(target_kind, target_id, field, model_id)`. If
  source field unchanged and model unchanged, reuse.

### Model swap UX

**Why a model swap is disruptive:** embeddings only have meaning
inside the vector space of the model that produced them. After a
swap, every stored vector is in the OLD model's space, but the
query vector at the next turn will be embedded under the NEW model.
Cosine similarities between them are not comparable — retrieval is
effectively broken until every stored vector has been recomputed
under the new model. A "lazy" or "on-demand" re-embed strategy
doesn't degrade gracefully here; it just gives the user broken
retrieval over a partial subset until convergence. The realistic
options are full re-index (with the system temporarily limited
while it runs) or accept the risk and skip.

The dialog fires whenever `app_settings.embedding_model_id`
textually changes and cached embedding rows under the old value
exist. No attempt to detect "same model, different label" cases —
any ID change is treated as a swap. AlertDialog surfaces two
options:

- **Re-index in background.** Default. Background job re-embeds all
  existing rows under the new model. While the job runs, retrieval
  is in a degraded state — the system surfaces a "re-indexing X /
  N — retrieval limited" indicator on UI surfaces that consume
  retrieval (composer, history pane, world panel). Progress
  visible; cancellable. On cancel, the swap is rolled back to the
  previous `embedding_model_id` so retrieval recovers full quality.
- **Skip re-index.** Bulk-updates the recorded model id to the new
  value without recomputing vectors. Disclaimer shown ("retrieval
  quality may silently degrade if the new model produces different
  vectors than the cached ones"). Escape hatch — useful when the
  user knows the underlying model is unchanged (relabeling a custom
  import, canonical-id refactor, etc.) and accepts the risk.

A standalone "Re-index now" button stays available in the same
settings panel for users who want to force a re-index without
changing the model.

## Query construction — three-vector stack

Each retrieval pass embeds three queries and ranks candidates against
each, blending the per-vector similarities into a final score per
candidate.

### Q1: User action

The user's action text for the current turn. Always available
(retrieval runs after the Pre phase commits the user-action delta).
Short, signal-dense, embeds fast.

### Q2: Structural digest

Code-template floor + optional piggyback enrichment:

```
{sceneEntities.names}, {currentLocation.name}.
Active threads: {activeThreads.titles}.
Era: {era_name}.
{summary}    -- optional, from piggyback trailing block
```

Structural fields are computed from existing data; deterministic,
free, always available. The summary line is **optional enrichment**
from the piggyback trailing block (one sentence, ~30 tokens). When the
trailing block parses, summary is included; when it doesn't, the
structural template stands alone.

The bet on enrichment-not-dependence: rich digests improve retrieval
ranking but the structural template is genuinely rich on its own
(names, location, arc context). Tying retrieval quality to "the model
emitted a clean structured block this turn" was rejected as too
fragile at narrative-generation temperatures.

### Q3: Heuristic prose extract

Sentence-level signal-density extraction from the last narrative
entry. Avoids embedding 400-1000 tokens of filler-heavy prose;
isolates the high-signal slices.

Per-sentence scoring:

| Signal                                                                                                         | Weight |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Named-entity hit (matches entity-name index)                                                                   | High   |
| Lore-keyword hit (matches `lore.keywords` index)                                                               | High   |
| Action-verb hit (drew, struck, said, killed, swore, revealed, named, refused, agreed, ran, fled, found, lost…) | Medium |
| Dialogue (quoted span)                                                                                         | Medium |
| Brevity bonus (short impactful sentences)                                                                      | Low    |

Top-K sentences (K=3-5) concatenated, embedded as one vector. Reuses
the entity-name and lore-keyword indexes already built for the
[hybrid retrieval](#hybrid-retrieval-per-type) pathway.

What this catches that pure structural digest misses: terminology in
dialogue, action cues, references the digest's structural fields
don't carry. What it still misses: pure thematic / emotional signal,
pronoun-mediated reference (genuinely needs an LLM-emitted digest or
coreference resolution; not chased in v1).

### Blending — weighted average

Each candidate scores against each query vector via cosine similarity.
Final score is the weighted average:

```
score(c) = w_action × sim(Q1, c) + w_digest × sim(Q2, c) + w_prose × sim(Q3, c)
```

Default weights (placeholder; user-tunable in advanced settings):

```
w_action = 0.35
w_digest = 0.35
w_prose  = 0.30
```

Weighted average over `max` because `max` lets a single strong signal
dominate, which is recall-favoring but noisy. Weighted average is the
consensus shape. Hybrid (`α × max + (1-α) × weighted_avg`) is reserved
for if real testing surfaces over-conservative retrieval.

### Cold start

Turn 1 has no prior user action AND no prior AI entry to embed
against. Fall back to:

- Q1: user's first action (available; retrieval runs after Pre).
- Q2: wizard-derived structural digest. No piggyback summary line yet.
- Q3: heuristic prose extract from the **opening** entry.

When a component is missing, weights re-normalize across the remaining
queries. No special cold-start logic beyond that.

---

## Candidate pools

The retrieval pool per type after the structural floor is satisfied.

### Structural floor — always inject

| Source                         | Notes                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recent buffer                  | Last `recentBuffer` entries verbatim; with `fullChapterInBuffer=true`, current chapter is also verbatim in addition |
| Active + in-scene entities     | `entities.status='active' AND id ∈ sceneEntities` — short-circuits `injection_mode`                                 |
| Current location entity        | `currentLocationId` — same short-circuit                                                                            |
| Active threads                 | `threads.status='active'` — must-inject as structural framing                                                       |
| `injection_mode='always'` rows | Across entities / lore / threads — user-intent override                                                             |

### Chapter summaries pool

Closed `chapters` rows form a separate retrieval pool. Each chapter's
`summary` (plus `theme` and `keywords`) is the ranking content; the
pool is small (one row per closed chapter) and grows linearly with
story length.

A matched chapter — one that survives MMR + budget-fill and ends up
injected — is also used as a structural cue to boost happenings
within its range (see
[Chapter-match boost on happenings](#chapter-match-boost-on-happenings)).

**Why chapter summaries are real signal that happenings + lore don't
already cover:** chapter summaries are the **mid-level** "what was
this chapter ABOUT" layer. Happenings are atomic events; lore is
timeless reference. Neither captures meta-narrative — "Aria's arc in
this chapter shifted from solo journey to political conspirator" —
which is what a chapter summary expresses. When budget is tight on
long stories, one chapter summary at ~100 tokens covers ground that
5-10 happenings would take ~400 tokens to convey. Compression ratio
matters.

**Cold start:** pool is empty until the first chapter closes. Budget
allocated to chapter summaries goes unused (hard partitions; no
spillover). Acceptable.

### Three-sub-pool entity model

The retrieval pool for entities splits by status:

| Sub-pool             | Framing in prompt                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Active off-scene** | "Currently elsewhere; available for retrieval reference"                 |
| **Staged**           | "Available to introduce when narratively appropriate"                    |
| **Retired**          | Default-excluded; opt-in via `injection_mode='always'` for ghosts/echoes |

All three compete for the entity-type token budget. Embedding
similarity to the current scene digest determines which staged
entities float up — a wizard-curated character "the queen who rules
the throne room" auto-surfaces when the scene digest mentions the
throne room.

### Pool exclusions

- **Common-knowledge happenings** with `common_knowledge=1` skip the
  awareness graph entirely; ranked directly off `sim_blend + kw_boost`
  (see
  [Common-knowledge happenings — special case](#common-knowledge-happenings--special-case)).
- **Pending / resolved / failed threads** join the ranker pool subject
  to `injection_mode`.
- **Same-name suppression** — staged entities whose names appear in
  recent un-classified buffer prose are suppressed from the current
  pool (see
  [`edge-cases.md → Name collision`](./edge-cases.md#name-collision-and-disambiguation)).

---

## Hybrid retrieval per type

Embedding similarity is the primary signal but not the only one.
Different types benefit from different signal blends.

| Type                  | Primary                         | Complement                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lore**              | Embedding (title + body)        | Keyword on `lore.keywords` — proper nouns, in-world terminology                          |
| **Entities**          | Embedding (name + description)  | Keyword on `name` — direct prose reference                                               |
| **Happenings**        | Embedding (title + description) | Keyword on `awareness.source` strings — verbatim names / places in awareness descriptors |
| **Threads**           | Embedding (title + description) | None                                                                                     |
| **Chapter summaries** | Embedding (summary + theme)     | Keyword on `chapters.keywords` — chapter-level browse keywords (Phase 2 output)          |

For lore particularly, the keyword pathway is load-bearing — embedding
models have no semantic prior on user-authored proper nouns
("Vael" / "the Aetherium" / "blood-bound"). Keyword matching catches
exact lexical hits that embeddings miss; embeddings catch thematic /
conceptual matches that keyword can't (synonym, paraphrase). Together
they cover.

### Keywords schema

| Type         | Keyword surface                   | Source                                                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lore`       | `keywords TEXT` (JSON `string[]`) | User-authored at create time, OR lore-mgmt agent emits at chapter close |
| `entities`   | `name` field                      | Implicit                                                                |
| `happenings` | `awareness.source` strings        | Implicit (per-row, not per-happening)                                   |
| `threads`    | (none)                            | —                                                                       |

Lore's `keywords` field is added; `lore.tags` stays separate (tags are
user-meaningful labels; keywords are retrieval-targeted strings).

### `auto` injection mode

`injection_mode='keyword_llm'` is renamed to `'auto'` across entities,
lore, and threads. The `_llm` suffix was misleading once retrieval
became keyword + embedding (LLM is fallback only, not primary). `auto`
honestly describes the user contract: the system handles it via
whatever signals are available (keyword + embedding + LLM fallback
when both miss). Implementation can evolve without changing
user-facing semantics.

Schema migration: rename enum value across data-model and any code
references; UI copy updates accordingly.

---

## Pinning — `decay_resistance`

The "load-bearing despite dissimilar" signal that semantic similarity
will miss. Lives on awareness rows (and on common-knowledge
happenings) as an auxiliary attribute.

### Pinning schema

```
happening_awareness {
  ... existing fields ...
  decay_resistance REAL DEFAULT 0   -- ∈ `[0, 1]`; scales decay rate
}
```

`decay_resistance = 0` means full decay (today's behavior). `1` means
no decay (effectively a hard pin). Fractional values for
"mostly persistent."

### Why on awareness only

Awareness is per-character; severity / importance is naturally
per-character ("Aria's mother died" is severity-95 to Aria, severity-10
to a stranger who heard rumors). Storing on `happening_awareness` lets
the per-character variance survive into retrieval ranking, which is
itself per-character via POV-awareness.

Common-knowledge happenings (`common_knowledge=1`) skip the awareness
graph entirely and **don't carry a `decay_resistance` signal**.
They're already pinned by being common knowledge — adding a per-row
pin would be redundant. The ranker scores them by relevance only
(see
[Common-knowledge happenings — special case](#common-knowledge-happenings--special-case)).
Trade-off: user can't force-pin a load-bearing common-knowledge
happening that's consistently semantically dissimilar to scenes. v1
floor; rare in practice.

### Sources

| Source                                | Cadence                    | Signal                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User explicit toggle**              | Any time                   | UI affordance on awareness rows in Plot / World panels. Sets `decay_resistance = 1`. Permanent until user toggles off.                                                     |
| **Classifier severity at extraction** | Periodic classifier writes | When emitting an awareness row, classifier judges severity ∈ `[0, 1]` from prose context. Subjective, model-judged. Becomes the default `decay_resistance` on the new row. |
| **Lore-mgmt housekeeping**            | Chapter close              | Reviews closed-chapter awareness rows; can adjust `decay_resistance` upward (recognized structural) or downward (turned out incidental). Conservative bias.                |

### Ranker semantics

The ranker uses `decay_resistance` to bias the budget queue: pinned
items get **preferred slots in the budget queue, ranked by recency
among themselves**, with the embedding-similarity-ranked tail filling
remaining budget. Pinned items do **not bypass the budget** — long
stories with hundreds of pinned rows still fall to budget pressure,
oldest-pinned-first. Absolute always-inject would break on long
stories.

Decay model: salience decays per chapter, scaled by
`(1 - decay_resistance)`. Exact math at the
[ranker scoring function](#scoring-function).

### What doesn't drive `decay_resistance`

- **In-prose recall reinforcement** — the idea that "the model wrote
  about this happening, so it must be important; bump the pin" — was
  rejected as a positive feedback loop. Pinned items get retrieved
  more, prose references them more, pin grows, monopolizes budget. No
  clean cap. Dropped.
- **Common-knowledge auto-emission by classifier** — was rejected as
  too risky. "Is this widely known" requires social-spread reasoning
  the prose doesn't reliably encode. `common_knowledge` stays
  user-only; classifier never auto-emits.

### Pin contradiction reconciliation

A `death` event auto-pinned at chapter 3 becomes obsolete when chapter
25 reveals "actually alive." Auto-detection of contradicting evidence
is parked for v1 — accept the cost (some stale-pin retrieval noise);
user can manually un-pin. Lore-mgmt eventually catches the most
egregious cases at chapter close.

---

## Per-type retrieval budgets

Token budget split across candidate types is user-configurable per
story. Gives explicit control over context allocation.

### Additive UI

User adjusts individual sliders for each type's allocation; the total
emerges as the sum. **No "set total budget, then assign percentages"
gymnastics** — sliders show absolute token counts, total appears
beneath them.

```
Entities:    [====      ]  1200 tokens
Lore:        [======    ]  1800 tokens
Happenings:  [=====     ]  1500 tokens
Threads:     [==        ]   400 tokens
                          ─────
Total:                    4900 tokens
```

The user feels the cost directly per type. Tuning is "I want more
lore in retrieval; drag the slider up" — not "I want lore at 35% of
an abstract whole."

### Hard partitions in v1

Unused tokens within a type's allocation stay empty. No cross-type
spillover. Trade: predictable behavior over slightly-better window
utilization. Spillover is post-v1; the schema supports adding it later
without breaking changes.

### Structural floor takes budget first

The numbers in per-type budgets apply to **what's left after the
structural floor seats**. Recent buffer + active+in-scene entities +
their location + active threads consume tokens unconditionally. Then
prompt-overhead reservation. Then the per-type retrieval budgets
allocate the remainder.

UI shows allocations as **"of remaining ~X tokens after structural
inject"**, not "of full window." Cast-heavy scenes shrink the
available pool dramatically; misleading the user about the relative
cost would let them paint into a corner.

### POV-awareness scope

Retrieval queries the awareness graph as the **union of all in-scene
characters' awareness rows** in both adventure and creative modes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM happening_awareness
WHERE character_id IN ({sceneEntities ∩ characters})
```

Lead-only filtering was considered for adventure mode and rejected.
Characters can feasibly acquire knowledge without the protagonist
present (detached-POV moments), and the `narration` setting
(`first | second | third`) is the lever for POV-constraint via
prompt, not retrieval. The risk of leakage (AI mentions things the
protagonist shouldn't know) is bounded by narration-mediated
prompting; the schema supports tightening to lead-only later if
real-world testing shows persistent leakage.

---

## The ranker

The ranker turns per-type candidate pools into the actual injected
slice for each turn. **Inputs** are settled per the rest of this doc:
three query vectors with weighted-average blending, per-type candidate
pools with the three-sub-pool entity model, per-type token budgets
(additive sliders, hard partitions in v1), and per-row signals
(`decay_resistance` on awareness, `priority` on lore, recency
markers, `injection_mode='always'` overrides).

Independent ranker pass per type. Per-type budgets are hard
partitions, so types don't compete with each other; each type's
ranker fills its own slice.

### Scoring function

Per-candidate score combines four signals — multiplicative
integration for similarity × recency × pin, additive for the
keyword complement, with a high-similarity bypass for revival of
deeply-decayed rows:

```
score(c) = max(
    sim_blend(c) × recency_factor(c) + kw_boost(c),
    (sim_blend(c) − τ_revive) if sim_blend(c) ≥ τ_revive else 0
)

recency_factor(c) = exp(−λ_type × chapters_old(c) × (1 − pin_signal(c)))
```

Where:

- **`sim_blend(c)`** — weighted-avg of cosine similarities between `c`
  and each of the three query vectors (action / structural digest /
  prose extract). Already computed in the
  [query stack](#query-construction--three-vector-stack).
- **`pin_signal(c)`** — `decay_resistance` for awareness rows,
  `priority/100` for lore, `0` for entities and threads (no
  continuous pin signal in v1).
- **`λ_type`** — type-specific decay rate (table below).
- **`chapters_old(c)`** — chapters since `c` became relevant
  (`learned_at_entry` for awareness, `created_at` mapped to chapter
  for happenings without awareness, `updated_at` for entities and
  threads, effectively zero for lore since lore is timeless).
- **`kw_boost(c)`** — additive bonus when the keyword index hits
  (lore keywords, entity name, awareness `source` string). Default
  magnitude `0.10`. Zero if no keyword pathway exists for the type.

The multiplicative pin-into-recency integration is the key shape:

- `pin_signal = 1` flat-tops decay (item maintains full `sim_blend`
  forever).
- `pin_signal = 0` decays normally.
- Fractional values for "mostly persistent."

Pinned items naturally float higher in the ranker without a separate
tier; budget pressure still drops them when oversubscribed (see
[Budget-fill termination](#budget-fill-termination)). The
"long story with hundreds of pins" failure mode handles itself —
pins compete on similarity to current scene, only the
diverse-and-relevant ones survive MMR + budget.

### High-similarity bypass — revival of decayed memories

The decay model handles ageing well but creates a structural gap on
long-arc stories: a chapter-3 happening with `dr = 0.3` at chapter
60 has `recency_factor ≈ 0.06` even at perfect `sim_blend = 1.0`,
falling below the noise floor. Without intervention, decayed
memories are invisible to retrieval — they can never resurface even
when extremely relevant to the current scene.

The bypass term in the scoring function fixes this:

```
bypass_score(c) = sim_blend(c) − τ_revive   when sim_blend(c) ≥ τ_revive
                  0                          otherwise
```

A candidate whose embedding similarity to the current scene exceeds
`τ_revive` (default 0.85, tunable) gets a score floor of
`sim_blend - τ_revive`, ignoring the recency-and-pin decay. Old
rows that perfectly match a callback scene resurface; old rows
that match weakly or generically don't.

The semantics: "if this old thing matches the current scene that
closely, it's probably a real callback — surface it regardless of
age." Conservative threshold (0.85+) limits false positives from
generic prose-similarity matches.

**Interaction with other mechanisms:**

- **Retrieval-frequency tracking** still applies. Bypass-revived
  rows participate in the counter; if they keep getting revived
  turn after turn, they show up in
  [phase 3d's high-frequency candidate set](./chapter-close.md#3d--awareness-pin-tuning)
  at next chapter close, where lore-mgmt can promote them to higher
  `decay_resistance` (or leave alone if marginal). Self-correcting.
- **Budget pressure** still gates inclusion. Revival doesn't
  bypass the budget; it only bypasses the score-threshold floor.
  An old row that bypasses can still lose to recent rows that
  out-score it within the budget.
- **MMR diversity** still applies. Multiple bypass-revived rows
  that semantically cluster will dedup against each other.

The risk — false-positive revivals where high embedding similarity
isn't load-bearing narrative connection — is bounded by `τ_revive`
height, by budget pressure, and by the lore-mgmt review path.
Worst residual case: user notices via
[memory probe](./followups.md#v1-blocking) that a row is being
revived spuriously and manually unpins or demotes via World panel.

### Chapter-match boost on happenings

When chapter summaries survive their own ranking pass and end up
injected, their content is contextually relevant — and the
happenings that occurred within those chapters' ranges inherit some
of that relevance. The happenings ranker applies a multiplier to
such candidates:

```
chapter_boost(h, matched_chapters) =
  if any(ch.range contains h.occurred_at_entry for ch in matched_chapters):
    1.3   # tunable; default range 1.2-1.5
  else:
    1.0

score(h) = (sim_blend × recency_factor + kw_boost) × chapter_boost(h, matched_chapters)
```

`matched_chapters` is the set of chapters that survived the
chapter-summary pool's MMR + budget-fill — actually injected, not
just ranked highly. The boost only fires for chapters whose content
the prompt will actually carry context about.

**Pipeline impact** — chapter-summary ranking must complete before
happenings ranking starts so `matched_chapters` is known. Other
types (entities, lore, threads) run independently in parallel.

**Why this matters.** Without the boost, happening retrieval is
"scattered" — top-K by similarity across the entire story, often
disconnected. With the boost, top-K tends to cluster around the
chapters most relevant right now: a more narratively coherent slice
of context for the LLM.

### Scale assumptions

Pool sizes grow substantially with story length. Realistic projection
for a story at `chapterTokenThreshold = 24k`, ~500 tokens/turn
(~48 turns/chapter), and 1-2 happenings extracted per turn:

| Metric                                                   | Per chapter | At 30 chapters | At 60 chapters |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Happenings                                               | 50-100      | 1.5-3k         | 3-6k           |
| Awareness rows (5-10× happenings depending on cast size) | 250-1000    | 7.5-30k        | 15-60k         |
| Embedding storage (~1.5KB per happening)                 | ~100-150KB  | ~3-5MB         | ~5-10MB        |

The decay-rate defaults below are **guesses calibrated for these
volumes** — calibrated in the sense of "λ=0.07 produces sensible-
looking ranking on toy data," not "λ=0.07 has been validated against
real stories." Real testing on real stories will move these numbers,
possibly by 2× or more in either direction. The
[empirical-tuning followup](./followups.md#v1-blocking) covers the
calibration pass; until that lands, these are starting points
exposed for power-user override in advanced settings.

Architecturally, these volumes drove several choices we already
made: pre-filter to top-200 before MMR (otherwise ranking thousands
of candidates per turn gets expensive), per-type hard-partitioned
budgets (otherwise happenings drown out lore), and chapter-match
boost on happenings (otherwise top-K from thousands of candidates is
scattered rather than coherent).

### Per-type decay rates

Sensible starting defaults; tunable per story in advanced settings:

| Type                   | `λ`          | `recency_factor = 0.5` at | Rationale                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Happenings (awareness) | 0.07         | ~10 chapters              | Events get stale, but not as fast as a 5-chapter half-life would imply        |
| Entities (off-scene)   | 0.025        | ~28 chapters              | Cast turnover is slow                                                         |
| Threads                | 0.025        | ~28 chapters              | Arc presence is slow                                                          |
| Lore                   | 0 (no decay) | —                         | Effectively timeless; ranks purely on `sim_blend × (priority/100) + kw_boost` |
| Chapter summaries      | 0 (no decay) | —                         | Mid-level historical record; ranks purely on `sim_blend + kw_boost`           |

Lore and chapter summaries don't decay — they're inherently long-arc
content. Lore is timeless reference; chapter summaries are factual
records of "what happened in chapter X." Both rank purely on
relevance to the current scene.

These defaults are starting guesses; the empirical-tuning followup
calibrates them against real story data.

### Common-knowledge happenings — special case

Common-knowledge happenings (`happenings.common_knowledge=1`) bypass
the awareness graph entirely; no awareness rows exist for them. They
score by:

```
score(c) = sim_blend(c) + kw_boost(c)
```

No recency decay, no pin signal. They're pinned by being common
knowledge; rank purely on relevance to current scene. If a
common-knowledge happening becomes irrelevant to current scene
context, it ranks low and falls out of budget naturally; if relevant,
it always gets considered for injection.

The small gap: a load-bearing common-knowledge happening that's
consistently semantically dissimilar to relevant scenes can't be
force-injected by the user (no `injection_mode` on happenings, no
`decay_resistance` per the simplification). v1 floor; rare in
practice. If real signal shows it bites, extend `injection_mode` to
happenings or add a `decay_resistance` column.

### Diversity — MMR

Pure top-K by raw score surfaces near-duplicate clusters (three
similar awareness rows about Aria's grief crowd out orthogonal
signals). Maximal Marginal Relevance penalizes redundancy:

```
mmr_score(c, S) = λ_div × score(c) − (1 − λ_div) × max(sim(c, c') for c' in S)
```

Where:

- `S` is the already-selected set (initially empty; `max(...)` is `0`).
- `sim(c, c')` is embedding similarity between candidates.
- `λ_div = 0.75` default — strong relevance preference, mild
  diversity. Tunable.

Iteratively pick the candidate with highest `mmr_score`, add to `S`,
recompute, pick next.

**Per-type MMR.** Diversity runs independently within each candidate
type. A happening shouldn't dedup against a lore entry; they're
different shapes carrying orthogonal signal.

**Cost.** O(N × K) per type. For typical pools (hundreds), sub-
millisecond. For long-running stories with thousands of awareness
rows, **pre-filter to top-200 by raw score before MMR**. Trade:
candidates ranking ~200th by raw score are unlikely to make it into
the budget anyway, so the pre-filter doesn't lose meaningful
selections.

### Budget-fill termination

Greedy fill within the per-type budget after MMR ranking:

```python
selected = []
remaining = type_budget

for c, mmr_score in mmr_ranked_candidates:
    if mmr_score < min_score_threshold:
        break              # entered noise territory; stop
    cost = token_estimate(c)
    if cost > remaining:
        continue           # too large for what's left; try smaller candidates
    selected.append(c)
    remaining -= cost

return selected
```

**Edge cases:**

- **Candidate larger than remaining budget** — skip and try next.
  Don't truncate (truncated candidates are noise).
- **Candidate larger than the entire type budget** — skip permanently.
  Surface in Story Settings as a warning ("your happenings budget is
  below the median happening size; consider raising it").
- **`min_score_threshold = 0.15`** (cosine baseline) — rows below
  this are essentially semantically unrelated to current scene;
  including them clutters the prompt with noise. Underutilized budget
  is fine; we don't backfill with low-relevance content.

No "must-fill-budget" mode. The user's expectation is "good context
or no context, not bad context."

### Token estimation

Tiktoken-based, computed at ranker time:

```
token_count(c) = tiktoken(c.rendered_field_text) + type_overhead(type_of(c))
```

Per-type overhead is a small constant for the Liquid macro / block
wrapping (entity character_block ≈ 30 tokens, lore block ≈ 10 tokens,
happening memory block ≈ 20 tokens, thread block ≈ 10 tokens).
Measured empirically once the macros are concrete; constant in code
thereafter.

**No stored column on candidate tables.** Tokenization is fast enough
(microseconds per row); per-turn cost is sub-millisecond total.
Ranker passes cache results in memory for reuse within the turn.

If real perf testing later shows tokenization is a bottleneck, add a
`token_count INTEGER` column per candidate table with cache
invalidation on row update. Don't pre-optimize.

### Per-turn cost budget

Dominant terms:

| Step                                        | Cost                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Embedding three query vectors               | ~20ms local / ~50ms API (parallelized)             |
| Cosine similarity batch over candidate pool | <10ms for 1000s of candidates with vectorized math |
| MMR per type (after pre-filter to 200)      | <5ms per type                                      |
| Token estimation                            | <1ms total                                         |
| Budget fill                                 | <1ms                                               |

Target: <100ms total for typical stories on local embedder. Acceptable
even for the longest typical pools.

### Tuning surface

Defaults are conservative; expose for power-user override in App
Settings → Memory → Advanced:

- Per-type `λ` decay rates.
- `λ_div` MMR diversity vs. relevance.
- `kw_boost` magnitude.
- `min_score_threshold` noise floor.
- `τ_revive` high-similarity bypass threshold (default 0.85;
  controls when decayed-but-extremely-similar rows resurface).
- Per-query weights (`w_action`, `w_digest`, `w_prose`) — already in
  the [query stack](#query-construction--three-vector-stack).

Real signal from testing tunes these. v1 ships with defaults; the
[Threshold tuning followup](./followups.md#v1-blocking) covers the
empirical calibration pass once test stories exist.
