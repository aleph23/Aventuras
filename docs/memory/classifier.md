# Periodic classifier contract

A background pipeline that runs on a configurable cadence (see
[`cadence.md → classifierCadence`](./cadence.md#user-tunable-knobs))
and reads the recent prose window not yet covered by piggyback's
per-turn writes. Its job is populating the structured graph that
retrieval queries against. Declares against the framework's Pipeline
shape per [`generation-pipeline.md`](../generation-pipeline.md); see
[Background-task framing](#background-task-framing) below for its
declaration values.

## What the classifier writes

- **Happenings** — `happenings`, `happening_involvements`,
  `happening_awareness`. New rows for events extracted from the prose
  window, with `decay_resistance` set per awareness row from the
  model's per-character severity judgment at extraction time.
- **Status transitions** — `entities.status` flips:
  - `staged → active` when prose mentions a staged entity in scene
    (the slow path; see
    [Staged-entity promotion](./edge-cases.md#staged-entity-promotion)).
  - `active → retired` on hard finality signals only (death, exile,
    faction-disbanded). Conservative bias.
- **First-introduction descriptions** — when the classifier extracts
  a genuinely new character (no name match against existing
  entities), it authors the initial `description` from prose. After
  first introduction, the classifier never amends `description` (the
  authorship contract in
  [`data-model.md → World-state storage`](../data-model.md#world-state-storage)
  remains intact).

## ID handling in classifier output

References to existing entities in the classifier's structured
output are **placeholders** (`c1`, `l1`, `hp1`, …), not the
underlying `char_<uuid>` / `loc_<uuid>` / etc. forms — the
substitution layer swaps both directions
(see [`generation-pipeline.md → ID placeholder substitution`](../generation-pipeline.md#id-placeholder-substitution)).
The placeholder universe shown to the classifier covers entities
in the prompt's structured entity/lore/happening lists.

When the classifier creates a brand-new entity, it emits the
entity as a **full object with no `id` field** — name, description,
state fields, etc. Parse allocates a fresh `char_<uuid>` (or other
kind-appropriate prefix) and registers it in the idMap if subsequent
output references it. Any subsequent reference in the same response
uses a temporary handle the LLM picks; parse maps the temporary
handle to the newly-allocated UUID.

This separation keeps the LLM's surface area small (no UUID
copying) while preserving the existing disambiguation flow below
unchanged — name-match + embedding-similarity work on prose +
embeddings regardless of how identity is rendered to the model.

## Embedding compute boundary

The classifier emits rows but does **not** embed them: new
happenings, first-introduction entity descriptions, and any other
write touching an embedded field land `embedding_stale = 1` and
leave the vector to the pre-retrieval sync stage, per the
[sync-before-read contract](./retrieval.md#compute-lifecycle).
Nothing embeds on the classifier's write path; the dirty rows are
picked up by the opportunistic background worker between turns and,
as a backstop, by the next retrieving pipeline's sync stage — so the
embed cost stays off the user-facing critical path, decoupled from
the write. (The classifier itself runs as a background pipeline; see
[Background-task framing](#background-task-framing) below.)

If the embedder is still unavailable when that sync stage runs
(local model initializing, provider mode network down), the row
stays `embedding_stale = 1` and absent from vec0, and the stage's
blocking failure path applies. No classifier-specific deferral
mechanism — same path as any other dirty row.

The classifier does not modify already-embedded fields on existing
rows. Status flips touch `entities.status` only, which isn't
embedded. If a future extension lets the classifier modify an
embedded field, it flags the row dirty the same way — no special
path required.

The transient embedding computed in the disambiguation flow below
(extracted description for the similarity check) is a decision-time
computation, not a persisted embedding write — outside this
boundary.

## Disambiguation on new-character mentions

For every "new character" candidate the classifier extracts, code-side
reconciliation runs before the create / promote decision. Flow:

1. **Name lookup** against the entity index (active, staged, retired).
   O(1) hash check. The classifier itself doesn't need to know about
   every character; the index does.
2. **No name match** → genuinely novel character. Create fresh entity.
3. **Name match found** → embedding similarity between the
   classifier-extracted description and the existing entity's
   description. Existing entity's embedding is cached (see
   [`retrieval.md → Embedding infrastructure`](./retrieval.md#embedding-infrastructure));
   the extracted description embeds once.
   - **High similarity** (`sim ≥ τ_high`) → promote staged → active OR
     treat as already-known active mention. Update entity if the
     extracted description adds information.
   - **Low similarity** (`sim < τ_low`) → create new entity with
     `name_collision_flag = true` for World-panel review.
   - **Ambiguous** (`τ_low ≤ sim < τ_high`) → conservative create-new
     with the flag, defer to user.

Thresholds (`τ_high`, `τ_low`) are tunable. Defaults TBD empirically
once real story data exists; sensible starting ranges (e.g. 0.75 /
0.50 cosine) until tuning lands.

## Background-task framing

The periodic classifier runs as a background pipeline — a Pipeline
declaration in the framework's registry, same shape as per-turn and
chapter-close but with different concurrency / gating values:

| Field                           | Value                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kind`                          | `'periodic-classifier'`                                                                                                  |
| `gateBehavior`                  | `'no-gate'` — doesn't block user-source writes                                                                           |
| `concurrencyPolicy`             | `{ blockedBy: ['periodic-classifier', 'chapter-close'] }` — no double passes; blocked from starting during chapter-close |
| `affordance`                    | `'pill-only'` — folds into the generation indicator at low priority (see below)                                          |
| Write set (prose, not declared) | happenings, happening_involvements, happening_awareness, entity status flips, first-introduction entity descriptions     |

Write-set boundaries between the classifier and the piggyback / per-turn
pipeline are enforced via narrow action functions named for field-set
scope (see
[`generation-pipeline.md → Narrow action functions over write-set declarations`](../generation-pipeline.md#narrow-action-functions-over-write-set-declarations)),
not a typed declaration. The single-writer invariant relaxes to
**single-writer-per-write-set** in v1; piggyback's write-set and the
classifier's write-set are disjoint at the row-and-field granularity
(see [`cadence.md → Concurrency`](./cadence.md#concurrency)).

If the user starts a new turn while the classifier is mid-run, both
proceed. The classifier holds its own `actionId` for its writes; the
user-turn pipeline holds its own. That `actionId` is stamped
`source = periodic_classifier` (distinct from per-turn piggyback's
`ai_classifier`) and is **never an undo target** — CTRL-Z's
head-selection skips it (see
[`data-model.md → Entry mutability & rollback`](../data-model.md#entry-mutability--rollback)).
It survives only for crash recovery.

The classifier's `concurrencyPolicy.yieldsTo` stays empty — it does
NOT abort itself when a foreground _forward_ pipeline starts.
Discarding in-flight classifier work that doesn't conflict with the
new turn's writes is wasteful; the disjoint-write-set property makes
coexistence safe.

A _reversal_ is the exception, handled outside `yieldsTo`. Regenerate,
entry-delete rollback, swipe-switch, and CTRL-Z of a turn reverse prose
the classifier may be mid-consuming, so each brackets its positional
sweep with `await waitForClassifier('cancel')` plus a
`reversalInProgress` start-block (see
[`generation-pipeline.md → Prose reversals and the classifier barrier`](../generation-pipeline.md#prose-reversals-and-the-classifier-barrier)).
The classifier's part of that contract is one **abort-free critical
section**: its commit burst — one LLM response, one burst of deltas —
ignores `signal.aborted` once parsing begins and never returns
`aborted` holding committed deltas. So `'cancel'` either discards a
not-yet-committed run (the LLM stream is cancelled, keeping the
reversal near-instant) or lets a committed burst stand for the
positional sweep to reverse; the standard abort path needs no special
disposition.

**Pill priority.** The classifier surfaces on the existing
generation indicator pill with low priority — user-initiated
narrative wins when both are in flight; the classifier pill shows
when nothing higher is running. No ETA in the popover (run length
isn't predictable). Chapter-close uses `'pill-and-banner'`
(blocking workload, separate visual treatment); periodic classifier
shares the pill, not the banner. The pill is unconditional — if
something's generating it shows, no fail-only or quiet-success
mode.

## Settings · Memory · Classifier panel

The Story Settings · Memory tab surfaces classifier controls and
state for the active branch in a compact panel.

### Cadence config

In-place edit of `stories.settings.classifierCadence` and
`piggybackMode`. The buffer-aware indicator from
[`cadence.md → User-tunable knobs`](./cadence.md#user-tunable-knobs)
renders inline so the user sees the cadence-vs-recent-buffer
overlap.

### Status block

Reflects the classifier's current state:

- **Idle** — `Last run N turns ago, processed P happenings + Q awareness rows.`
- **Running** — `Running... processed N of M turns.` Mirrors the pill.
- **Retrying** — `⚠ Last run failed (X of 3 attempts), retrying in N minutes.` Visible to users who look in Settings; doesn't escalate elsewhere.
- **Failed-persistent** — `⚠ Classifier failed after 3 attempts: [reason].` Inline `[Retry]` + `[View error details]`. Also surfaces as a top-bar error pill in the affected story — same visual vocabulary as the cluster-1 staleness pill; tap routes back here. Two different reasons, one UX pattern: error pill is the discovery channel, Settings panel is the resolution channel.

### Manual override

`[Run classifier now]` triggers an immediate pass over unprocessed
turns. Disabled while a run is actively in flight; enabled in
**idle** and **retrying** states (lets the user preempt the
auto-retry backoff). The **failed-persistent** inline `[Retry]`
is the equivalent action surfaced from the loud-error path.

### Auto-retry policy

A failed run schedules auto-retry with exponential backoff: **30
seconds → 2 minutes → 5 minutes**. After 3 retries exhausted, the
classifier enters **failed-persistent** state. Cadence-triggered
runs suspend in that state — no point spamming a broken provider
on every cadence tick — until the user explicitly retries. Cadence
resumes from the next normal trigger after a retry succeeds.

The retry policy applies to whatever caused the failure (rate
limit, network drop, provider 5xx). Errors that aren't transient
(invalid API key, model removed from provider catalog) hit
failed-persistent on the original failure plus the three retries
just like any other; the user resolves at the source (re-key,
swap profile, etc.) rather than waiting for retries to magically
succeed.

### Persistence

Per-branch classifier status — current state, last-success-at,
last-error, retry-attempt count — persists alongside the branch.
Concrete shape (`branches.classifier_status?: JSON` field vs
sidecar table) is an implementation detail; this design pins what
gets stored, not where.

The panel sits in the same Memory tab as the embedder controls
(see
[`model-management.md → Embedder config`](./model-management.md#embedder-config--where-it-lives-in-settings))
and the cluster-1 staleness panel. Wire-level layout lands at the
per-screen Story Settings design pass.
