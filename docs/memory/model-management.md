# Embedding model management

Curated catalog, onboarding, on-disk layout, download flow, license
attestation, removal, init-failure handling, and staleness UI for
the embedding model the retrieval pipeline depends on. Companion to
[`retrieval.md`](./retrieval.md), which covers what retrieval does
with the model once it's installed.

---

## What this doc owns

- The model-side contract — catalog shape, file bundle, on-disk
  layout, where embedder config lives in Settings.
- The user-facing lifecycle — first-launch, swap, removal, license
  attestation, error states.

What it explicitly does not own:

- The retrieval algorithm or per-query KNN flow — see
  [`retrieval.md`](./retrieval.md).
- Wire-level wireframes for the App Settings and Story Settings
  Memory tabs — those land at the per-screen design pass; this doc
  defines the contract those screens have to satisfy.

---

## Curated catalog

A bundled JSON file, shipped with each app release, lists the
embedding models we've vetted for inclusion in the picker. v1 ships
with several entries spanning the size / performance trade-offs;
the user picks one (or imports a custom file, or skips and uses a
provider's embedder). The catalog is metadata only — no model files
are bundled with the app.

Per-entry shape:

```json
{
  "version": "2026-05-08",
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2-q8",
      "displayName": "MiniLM-L6 (lightweight)",
      "shortDescription": "Small, fast, English-focused. Default for mobile.",
      "size_bytes": 25000000,
      "dim": 384,
      "huggingfaceRevision": "<pinned commit hash>",
      "expectedSha256": {
        "model.onnx": "...",
        "tokenizer.json": "...",
        "tokenizer_config.json": "..."
      },
      "default_ep": {
        "android": "cpu",
        "ios": "cpu",
        "linux": "cpu",
        "macos": "cpu",
        "windows": "cpu"
      },
      "tags": ["mobile", "lightweight", "english", "default"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`id`** — canonical HuggingFace id; doubles as the storage folder
  name (sanitized) and the row's `model_id` value in vec0.
- **`huggingfaceRevision`** — a pinned commit hash. The model card
  and files are fetched at this revision. Defends against post-
  curation edits to the model card or weights.
- **`expectedSha256`** — known hashes for the three required files.
  Verified after download completion.
- **`default_ep`** — per-platform execution provider, set at
  curation time based on our pre-release testing. v1 default
  posture is `cpu` everywhere unless we have explicit test evidence
  justifying a non-CPU pick. User-overridable per-model in Settings
  (see [Embedder failures](#embedder-failures)). No runtime
  detection or try-and-fall-back; we ship what we tested.
- **`tags`** — UI filtering hints (mobile, desktop, lightweight,
  heavy, multilingual, etc.). One entry may carry the `default` tag
  for the recommended pick.

Catalog updates ship in app releases. Remote-fetch with bundled-
fallback is a possible later extension; v1 keeps it bundled-only.

---

## Onboarding

A new screen joins the first-launch flow after provider
configuration. Hard-gated: story creation is blocked until the user
either configures an embedder (curated download, custom import, or
provider embedder) or explicitly skips into Settings. There is no
retrieval fallback in v1 — embedder is required to create a story.
LLM-only retrieval is post-v1 parked-until-signal, see
[`parked.md → Mode-3 (LLM-only retrieval)`](../parked.md#mode-3-llm-only-retrieval).

Layout sketch:

```

│ [ Skip ]                          [ Next ]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Actions:

- **Pick a curated model + Next** — proceeds to the
  [Download flow](#download-flow) (license dialog, download,
  verification, attestation).
- **Advanced setup** — routes to Settings · Memory for cases
  onboarding doesn't surface inline: a
  [custom file import](#custom-file-import), or a provider embedder
  from a provider other than the one just configured. (An embedder
  on the just-configured provider is picked inline — onboarding
  Path B.) Returns to onboarding on completion.
- **Skip** — onboarding completes with the embedder unconfigured.
  Story creation is blocked until the user returns to Settings.
  This isn't a "fallback mode," just a deferred decision.

Onboarding shape mirrors the existing provider-configuration step
(see
[`onboarding.md → What gets seeded silently`](../ui/screens/onboarding/onboarding.md#what-gets-seeded-silently)
for the parallel pattern). Provider config and embedder config are
the two configuration gates v1 imposes on first-launch.

---

## Storage layout

Each installed model lives in a self-contained folder inside an
app-private embedders directory. Folder name is the model's
canonical `id` with `/` replaced by `--` to be filesystem-safe.

```
<embedders-root>/
  xenova--all-minilm-l6-v2-q8/
    model.onnx
    tokenizer.json
    tokenizer_config.json
    meta.json
    LICENSE.txt          # frozen at agreement time (curated path only)
    .attestation         # acceptance timestamp + license SHA256 + source URL + revision
    runtime.json         # { ep: 'cpu' | 'nnapi' | ..., source: 'catalog' | 'user' }; absent for curated until user overrides
  baai--bge-base-en-v1.5/
    ...
```

Per-platform `<embedders-root>`:

| Platform | Path                                                 |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Android  | `<internal>/files/embedders/`                        |
| iOS      | `<documents>/embedders/`                             |
| Linux    | `~/.local/share/Aventuras/embedders/`                |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/Aventuras/embedders/` |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\Aventuras\embedders\`                     |

The folder is self-contained — removal is a recursive delete, and
copying a folder to a new device transports the agreed-to license
along with the model. Custom imports follow the same shape (without
a `LICENSE.txt`); their `runtime.json` is always present, written
at import time when the user picks an EP.

---

## Download flow

The user-facing dialog for this flow is wireframed in
[`ui/patterns/embedder-download.md`](../ui/patterns/embedder-download.md)
— that pattern carries the per-state UI and copy. This section
captures the data semantics: what the system fetches, writes,
verifies, and persists.

For curated catalog entries:

1. User picks a model in onboarding or in Settings · Memory.
2. App fetches the model card from HuggingFace at the catalog
   entry's pinned `huggingfaceRevision`. If the fetch fails
   (network, HF unreachable), block with `Couldn't reach the model
source. Check your connection and try again.` No cached-license
   substitution — we explicitly want the live one at this revision.
3. **License dialog** renders: model name, total size, license
   title, scrollable license text, source URL, revision hash.
4. **Decline** — no download, no state change. User stays on the
   previous selection. Pre-download state.
5. **Accept** — download begins with progress bar, resumable on
   network blip. Each of the three required files is fetched and
   SHA256-verified against the catalog entry's expected hashes.
6. **Cancel mid-download** — distinct from Decline. The download
   stops, partial files are deleted, and no license-acceptance is
   recorded. License acceptance is contingent on completion (see
   [License attestation](#license-attestation)).
7. **All three files verified** — `LICENSE.txt` is written from the
   dialog text, `.attestation` is written with timestamp + license
   SHA256 + source URL + revision. The model is now usable.

Failure modes during the run:

- **SHA256 mismatch** on any file — abort the download, delete
  partial files, surface `Verification failed. The downloaded file
doesn't match the expected hash. Try again later.` Don't
  auto-retry; the mismatch may indicate corruption or a rotated
  upstream that the catalog hasn't caught up to.
- **Network drop** — pause the download with a Resume affordance.
  Standard download UX.
- **Disk-full** mid-download — abort and surface a clear error;
  delete partials.

**Implementation note — `@huggingface/hub`.** The official
[`@huggingface/hub`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@huggingface/hub)
JS SDK covers most of the curated path: `downloadFile({ repo, path,
revision })` returns a `Response` for an individual file, pinned to
the catalog entry's `huggingfaceRevision`; `modelInfo({ name,
revision })` fetches the model-card metadata used for license
rendering. Both work in browser-shaped runtimes (Expo, Electron
renderer). `snapshotDownload` is Node-only (uses a local cache
dir) and not what we want — it bypasses our per-model folder
layout. The downloader fetches the three required files
individually via `downloadFile`, streams to disk under
`<embedders-root>/<sanitized-id>/`, computes SHA256 against the
catalog's `expectedSha256`, and wraps resume/retry/progress
around the call site rather than inside the SDK.

### Custom file import

App Settings · Embedding models exposes "Import custom model" for users with a
local model file outside the curated catalog. The user provides
three files from the filesystem (`model.onnx`, `tokenizer.json`,
`tokenizer_config.json`). Flow:

1. **EP picker** — user selects the execution provider this model
   should run under (CPU, NNAPI, CoreML, xnnpack, etc., filtered
   to what the ORT build supports). Warning copy explains that
   the wrong choice can crash the app on subsequent embed calls.
2. **Smoke-test embed** runs under the picked EP and must return a
   vector of the expected dimensionality. Validation under the
   chosen EP catches the mismatch up front — if a different EP
   would have worked but the picked one crashes, the user finds
   out at import rather than at first turn-time use. On crash,
   the import is aborted and the user can try a different EP.
3. **Confirmation dialog**: `By using this model, you assert that
you have a license to do so. The file SHA256 hashes are
recorded for your reference. [Cancel / Import]`.
4. **On Import**: files copied into
   `<embedders-root>/<sanitized-id>/`, `.attestation` records
   user-attested license + import timestamp + computed SHA256s,
   `runtime.json` records the picked EP. No `LICENSE.txt` is
   written (none was fetched).

User-supplied id format follows the HF convention
(`<namespace>/<model>`); the app rejects ids that would collide
with an existing folder name.

---

## License attestation

Two paths produce different attestation records:

| Path             | License source                     | Attestation contents                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Curated download | Live HuggingFace fetch at revision | timestamp, license SHA256, source URL, revision hash, license text in `LICENSE.txt` |
| Custom import    | User's assertion                   | timestamp, file SHA256s, no license text                                            |

Acceptance is **per model file**, not per-app-version or per-story.
Removing and re-downloading a model triggers fresh license fetch
and re-acceptance — every download is its own agreement. This is
the rationale behind preferring live model-card fetch: it defends
against authors editing model cards post-curation.

If a future app release pins a newer `huggingfaceRevision` for an
existing catalog entry, the user's installed model still works —
its `.attestation` records the older revision. Users who pick that
catalog entry afresh download under the new revision and agree to
its license.

Acceptance is contingent on download completion. Cancelling mid-
download discards the not-yet-finalized acceptance — partial
installs don't count as agreement.

---

## Removal

App Settings · Embedding models list shows installed models. A per-model
overflow menu offers `Remove`. The dialog branches on whether any
story currently has the model selected:

- **Not selected by any story** — confirmation only. `Remove
[model]? This deletes the model file. [Cancel / Remove]`.
- **Selected by N stories** — warn-and-confirm, listing affected
  stories:

  > Stories _Title A_, _Title B_, _Title C_ use this embedding
  > model. After removal, those stories can't generate new
  > embeddings or run retrieval (the query vector needs an embedder
  > too) until you swap them to a different embedder. Already-computed
  > embeddings are preserved.
  >
  > `[ Cancel ]` `[ Remove ]`

The removal dialog deliberately does **not** offer an inline
re-index. Re-indexing requires picking a replacement embedder
first, which is a per-story decision living in Story Settings ·
Memory — not the global model list. After Remove, affected stories
start producing `embedding_stale = 1` rows on subsequent embedded-
field writes, and the recovery path runs through:

1. User opens an affected story; the
   [top-bar status pill](#top-bar-status-pill--discovery-surface-in-the-affected-story)
   surfaces the staleness.
2. Tap routes to Story Settings · Memory, where the
   [resolution panel](#settings--memory-tab--resolution-surface)
   names the missing model and offers `Switch embedder`.
3. Picking a new embedder fires the
   [`Model swap UX`](./retrieval.md#model-swap-ux) dialog, where
   `Re-index this story` does the actual rebuild.

Removal is a recursive delete of the model's folder (including
`LICENSE.txt` and `.attestation`). The user has to drive recovery
explicitly per story; we don't auto-migrate or auto-reassign.

---

## Embedder failures

**Init is lazy.** The embedder doesn't initialize at app launch.
First call (test button, story-creation finalization, turn-time
embed, retrieval query embed) brings the session up under the
configured EP. If init or any subsequent embed call fails, the
failure surfaces at the action that triggered it — never at boot.
This eliminates the "app crashes on launch from a misconfigured
EP" failure mode entirely; recovery is just opening Settings and
adjusting.

### Test button

App Settings exposes a `Test embedder` affordance per active
embedder configuration (the local model on the Embedding models
tab, the provider embedder on its Providers list). Tapping it runs
init + a smoke-test embed and
reports success or failure with diagnostics. Lets users verify
proactively rather than waiting for the first turn-time use.

### Failure surfaces

Possible failure points:

- **Init failure** — corrupt model file, missing native lib,
  EP-incompatible quant, OS API gap (the PoC's `xnnpack` hard-
  crash was an extreme example for our default model).
- **Embed call failure** post-init — provider mode network
  failure, rare on-device failure.

Both surface at the action that triggered them. Story-creation
finalization that fails to embed initial cast surfaces in the
wizard's commit step:
`Couldn't initialize the embedder. [Retry] [Settings] [Cancel]`.
The story isn't created until an embed succeeds; cancelling
discards wizard state.

### Embed failure is blocking

When an embed call fails for a row that's already been written to
its metadata table (turn-time emit, user-edit save, etc.), that
row gets `embedding_stale = 1` and the user-facing UX is
**identical to a failed LLM call**: blocking, must be resolved, no
ignore path.

A turn whose classifier emits 5 rows where 3 embed and 2 fail
lands in a half-committed state — 3 in vec0, 2 stale-flagged in
metadata. The user sees:

> Embedding failed for 2 rows. `[Retry]` `[Switch embedder]` `[Roll back this turn]`

The next-turn affordance is disabled until one is taken:

- **Retry** re-attempts the failed embeds. On success, stale flags
  clear, the turn fully commits, user proceeds.
- **Switch embedder** routes to Story Settings · Memory · Switch,
  firing the [Model swap UX](./retrieval.md#model-swap-ux) dialog.
  Re-index processes the staleness as part of the swap.
- **Roll back this turn** reverse-replays the entire turn's
  deltas, reverting both narrative and emitted rows. Returns to
  pre-turn state; the user can retry the turn from scratch.

The worker may still drain stale rows opportunistically (if the
embedder recovers and the next normal embed call succeeds, the
worker catches up the staleness in the same path). The blocking
UX is the user-facing contract; the worker is the same machinery
running under the hood. Staleness from the same embedder failing
is not a "queue for later, ignore for now" condition — see
[`retrieval.md → Compute lifecycle`](./retrieval.md#compute-lifecycle)
for the worker contract and the lifecycle-level framing.

---

## Staleness UI

The `embedding_stale` flag (per
[`retrieval.md → Compute lifecycle`](./retrieval.md#compute-lifecycle))
is surfaced in two places, layered for discovery and resolution:

### Settings · Memory tab — resolution surface

A panel per affected story:

> **Story name**
> 12 rows pending re-embed under MiniLM-L6.
> Reason: model removed / embedder offline / init failure / etc.
> `[ Switch embedder ]`

Lists every story with a non-zero stale-row count alongside the
blocking reason. The action is `Switch embedder`, which routes to
the embedder picker for that story; picking a different model
triggers the
[Model swap UX](./retrieval.md#model-swap-ux) dialog where
`Re-index this story` runs the rebuild.

If the blocking reason is recoverable on its own (provider network
blip, embedder mid-init), the user may not need to take action —
the worker drains pending rows automatically once the embedder
becomes available again. The panel still shows the state so the
user knows why retrieval is degraded; the action is offered for
the cases where the user wants to actively switch rather than wait.

### Top-bar status pill — discovery surface in the affected story

When the user is reading a story whose `embedding_stale` row count
is non-zero, an error-state pill appears in the top bar (same
visual language as other error pills — not a new vocabulary).
Tapping routes to the Memory settings panel for that story.

Two surfaces total: **where you fix it** (Settings panel) and
**where you discover it** (top-bar pill in the affected story).
Story list deliberately does not carry a per-row badge — too much
clutter for an indicator that's only relevant when the user is
actively in that story.

---

## Embedder config — where it lives in Settings

Embedder configuration is **not** routed through the Profiles tab.
Profiles are LLM-agent-shaped (temperature, max output, thinking
slider, structured output) — embedders share none of those
parameters. Forcing them into the profile shape would create UI
noise and a misleading conceptual link between two unrelated
concerns.

Three surfaces, three concerns (per
[`app-settings.md → Embedding models`](../ui/screens/app-settings/app-settings.md#generation--embedding-models)):

**App Settings · Embedding models tab** — manages the **installed
local models** themselves (infrastructure under Generation, not a
story default):

- Catalog list, Import custom, and Remove. Each installed model
  carries:
  - A `Test embedder` button that runs init then a smoke-test embed.
  - An `Execution provider` picker — defaults to the catalog
    `default_ep[platform]` for curated entries, or the user's pick
    at import time for custom entries. Override persists in the
    model's `runtime.json`. Warning copy on the picker explains
    that picking the wrong EP can crash the app on next embed
    call (which surfaces at action time per
    [Embedder failures](#embedder-failures), not at app launch).
- The cross-story staleness aggregate, plus "Re-index this story
  now" affordances when a story has staleness or a model-swap
  pending.

Provider-side embedding models are not installed here — they live on
each provider's Embedding models list under
[`Providers`](../ui/screens/app-settings/app-settings.md#generation--providers).

**App Settings · Memory tab** — the **default selection only** that
seeds new stories' settings:

- Embedder backend default (`local | provider`).
- The default-model selector: which installed local model (backend
  `local`), or which provider and embedding-capable model (provider
  dropdown grouped by configured providers, model dropdown filtered
  to that provider) when backend is `provider`.
- Per-type retrieval budgets (see
  [`retrieval.md → Per-type retrieval budgets`](./retrieval.md#per-type-retrieval-budgets)
  — already in scope).

**Story Settings · Memory tab** — per-story override of the default
selection. Same fields except the EP picker (per-story EP override
is parked — limited divergence data justifies one surface in v1).
Locked once the story has any embedded content (i.e. once any vec0
rows exist for that story's branches), unless the user explicitly
triggers the model-swap re-index path.

---

## Open items

- **Per-story embedding provider id.** Schema landed in
  [`data-model.md`](../data-model.md#app-settings-storage) —
  `embedding_provider_id` is FK into `app_settings.providers[].id`,
  required when `embeddingBackend === 'provider'`. UI surfaces in
  App Settings · Memory and Story Settings · Memory (provider
  dropdown grouped by configured providers, model dropdown filtered
  to that provider's embedding-capable models).
- **Per-story EP override.** Parked. The app-level `Execution
provider` picker covers the v1 use case; per-story override
  could revisit if real signal shows users wanting a different EP
  per story (unlikely with one device datapoint on EP divergence).
- **Catalog remote update path.** v1 ships catalog updates in app
  releases. If curation cadence ever needs to outpace app
  releases, a remote-fetched catalog with bundled fallback is the
  natural extension.
- **Encryption at rest for the model file and license text.** Not
  v1 — same posture as provider API keys.
