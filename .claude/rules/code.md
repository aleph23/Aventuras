# Code rules

Project-scoped rules for source edits. Auto-loads when Claude reads
or writes TypeScript / JavaScript under `app/`, `components/`,
`hooks/`, `lib/`, `types/`, `electron/`, or `scripts/`.

## Commenting discipline

Code should be self-documenting. Default to **no comments**. Only
write a comment when the **why** is non-obvious from the code —
a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround for a
specific platform bug, or behavior a reader would otherwise find
surprising.

**Never write:**

- Comments that narrate **what** the code does. The identifiers
  already say that.
- Comments that reference the current task, PR, or recent fix
  ("added for X flow", "fixes #123", "used by Y screen"). Those
  belong in the commit message and rot as the codebase evolves.
- Comments that compare to a prior approach ("the previous approach
  X didn't work, we're doing Y now", "we used to do Z but…").
  Git history is the source of truth for what changed and why.
- Multi-paragraph explanations or essay-style docblocks. If something
  genuinely needs that much prose, it belongs in `docs/`, linked from
  a one-line code comment.

**When a comment is justified**, keep it short (one line where
possible) and lead with the **why**, not the what:

```ts
// Container query: 1024px is the desktop-vs-narrow layout switch.
const NARROW_THRESHOLD_PX = 1024

// rn-primitives doesn't gate disabled clicks on web; needs inline style.
style={disabled ? { pointerEvents: 'none' } : undefined}
```

JSDoc / TSDoc on exported props or public APIs is fine when it
documents **contract** (allowed values, units, edge cases) rather
than implementation — that's prop-doc, not commentary.

## Import wildcards

Prefer named imports. Wildcard / namespace imports (`import * as X
from 'y'`) are banned **except** where the package is designed to be
consumed as a namespace.

**Mechanically enforced.** `eslint.config.js` carries a
`no-restricted-syntax` selector that blocks every
`ImportNamespaceSpecifier` whose source isn't `@rn-primitives/*`. The
exception list there mirrors the list below — when adding a new
permitted namespace package, update both this file and the selector
regex in `eslint.config.js` in the same commit.

**Required form for React:**

```ts
import { useState, useEffect, type ReactNode } from 'react'
```

**Not:**

```ts
import * as React from 'react' // banned
```

Same applies to other large libraries (`react-native`, `lodash`,
date utilities, etc.) — list the symbols actually used.

**Permitted namespace imports** (these packages export compound
primitives whose members are meant to be accessed through a
namespace alias):

- `@rn-primitives/*` — e.g. `import * as DialogPrimitive from
'@rn-primitives/dialog'`. Each module exports `Root`, `Trigger`,
  `Content`, `Portal`, `Close`, `Title`, `Description`, `Overlay`,
  etc. as a compound API; namespace import is the intended
  consumption pattern.
- Any other library that documents namespace import as its primary
  API shape.

If unsure whether a namespace import is permitted, check the
library's published examples. When in doubt, prefer named imports —
the rule is "specific by default."

When converting an existing wildcard import to named imports, grep
the file for `<Namespace>.member` references and pull each one into
the named-import list. Don't leave dangling `React.foo` references
after the import line changes.

## Module structure

`lib/*` modules expose a public API through their root `index.ts`;
code outside the module (including outside `lib/`) imports only from
there, enforced by `boundaries/dependencies`. Intra-module imports
are free, types are public, and `scripts/**` is exempt. See
[code-conventions.md → Module structure](../../docs/code-conventions.md#module-structure).

## State placement

Component-local `useState`; cross-component ephemeral in
`lib/stores/ui/`; domain-class Zustand stores expose mutators only —
no `setState` from outside the store or action layer. See
[code-conventions.md → State placement](../../docs/code-conventions.md#state-placement).

## Logging discipline

Semantic diagnostics route through `logger` (`error` / `warn` / `debug`)
from `@/lib/diagnostics` — never direct `console.*`, which bypasses the
master gate and never lands in `diagnosticsStore`. The ban is
mechanically enforced by `no-console` (off only inside `lib/diagnostics`
and the dev-only paths in `eslint.config.js`). See
[observability.md → Logger contract](../../docs/observability.md#logger-contract)
and [observability.md → Direct-console drift](../../docs/observability.md#direct-console-drift).

## Action layer

Cross-cutting transactional writes route through `lib/actions/<domain>/`,
mediating Zustand and SQLite as one unit. See
[code-conventions.md → Action layer](../../docs/code-conventions.md#action-layer).

## Component folder taxonomy

Primitives in `components/ui/`, domain-agnostic compounds in
`components/compounds/`, single-domain compounds in
`components/<domain>/`, shells in `components/shells/`. See
[code-conventions.md → Component folder taxonomy](../../docs/code-conventions.md#component-folder-taxonomy).

## i18n discipline

No raw user-facing strings; chrome routes through `t()`.
Convention-only until `i18next` lands (Slice 1.7). See
[code-conventions.md → i18n discipline](../../docs/code-conventions.md#i18n-discipline).

## Testing discipline

Unit-test logic (`lib/*`, pure functions, reducers, state machines,
parsers); UI behavior via smoke / Storybook / manual; no coverage
thresholds. See
[code-conventions.md → Testing discipline](../../docs/code-conventions.md#testing-discipline).

## Forms

Input clusters with a submit button use `react-hook-form`; inline
single inputs stay component-local. Convention-only until
`react-hook-form` lands (Slice 2.3). See
[code-conventions.md → Forms](../../docs/code-conventions.md#forms).

## pnpm and patches

pnpm is the only supported package manager, enforced by
`engines.pnpm`, `engine-strict=true`, and the `only-allow`
preinstall guard. Patches live under `patches/`. See
[code-conventions.md → pnpm and patches](../../docs/code-conventions.md#pnpm-and-patches).
