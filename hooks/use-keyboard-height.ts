/**
 * Tracks the on-screen keyboard's height. Returns 0 when keyboard
 * is hidden or on web (no soft keyboard).
 *
 * Used to extend a scrollable surface's bottom inset so content
 * pinned near the bottom — last list row, footer button — can be
 * scrolled into view above the keyboard rather than being covered
 * by it.
 *
 * iOS: subscribes to `keyboardWillShow` / `keyboardWillHide` so
 * the height tracks the keyboard animation start, enabling smooth
 * coordinated layout. Android: only `keyboardDidShow` /
 * `keyboardDidHide` are reliably available, so the inset shifts
 * after the keyboard finishes its animation. Acceptable on Android
 * since `windowSoftInputMode=adjustResize` (the default for Expo)
 * already handles the bulk of the avoidance natively.
