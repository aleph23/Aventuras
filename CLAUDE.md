# Aventuras

Cross-platform AI-collaborative writing app. Mobile via
Expo, desktop via Electron. Single Expo app shared across platforms;
Electron wraps the web build. Domain core: Stories → branches →
entries + entities + lore + threads + happenings (with awareness
links) + chapters + delta log. All data + config in SQLite — no env
vars, no BaaS.

## MCP tools

Two project MCP servers are configured in
[`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json):

### electron-mcp-server

Inspects and controls the Electron window during development. Useful
for debugging desktop-specific behavior, capturing screenshots of the
running app, and reading main-process logs.

Available tools:

- `get_electron_window_info` — window state, dimensions, URL
- `read_electron_logs` — main-process console output
- `send_command_to_electron` — invoke commands in the renderer
- `take_screenshot` — capture the running window

Spawns automatically via `npx` on tool invocation. Requires the
desktop app to be running (`pnpm desktop`); otherwise window-targeted
tools have nothing to attach to.

### storybook-mcp

Component-aware MCP for the Storybook design system, exposed at
`http://localhost:6006/mcp` by `@storybook/addon-mcp`.

**The Storybook dev server MUST be running first.** Without it, every
MCP tool call fails with a connection error. Start it in a separate
terminal before using any storybook-mcp tool:

```sh
pnpm storybook
```

If a tool call returns a connection / fetch error, the most likely
cause is the server isn't running yet — start it and retry.

## Workflow rules

- **Pre-commit hooks (`lefthook.yml`)** run prettier, eslint, and
  remark in parallel on staged files. Don't bypass with
  `--no-verify` — fix the underlying issue.
- **Commits**: prefer multiple focused commits over one omnibus
  commit when work is logically separable. Never amend committed
  work; create a new commit instead.
- **Commit messages**: subject ≤ 72 chars. Body optional and
  ≤ 6 lines when present — the `commit-msg` hook counts blank
  separators and the `Co-Authored-By` trailer toward the limit.
  Answer _why_; name what the diff doesn't show. Length matches
  substance — `chore:` / `fix:` commits rarely need a body.

  **Don't include**: diff restatement ("Updates X's prose about
  Y…"), adversarial-pass enumerations, drift-pass / pre-commit-hook
  fix lists, substrate or inventory sections that re-summarize the
  doc being committed, mini-changelogs of sub-followups created.
  These are process artifacts or duplicate the diff, the
  exploration record, or [`followups.md`](./docs/followups.md).

  **Do include** when relevant: resolved followup by name, the key
  contract/architectural decision in one paragraph, new sub-followups
  (one line each), pointer to the exploration record.

- **File moves**: use `git mv` to preserve history. Update inbound
  references in the same commit.

## Topic-scoped rules

[`.claude/rules/`](./.claude/rules/) holds rules that apply to **all
agents** working on this repo. Claude Code auto-loads them based on
the `paths` frontmatter when matching files are read.

**Other agents (Codex, Cursor, etc.) and human contributors must
read the applicable file at the start of any code or doc task.**
Auto-load is Claude-only; the rules themselves are universal. This
file is symlinked from `AGENTS.md`, so non-Claude agents that read
`AGENTS.md` land here.

- [`docs.md`](./.claude/rules/docs.md) — documentation conventions
  (anchor-link discipline, heading stability, followups hygiene,
  wireframe template, doc-tooling). Applies to any `docs/**` or
  `.claude/rules/**` work.
- [`code.md`](./.claude/rules/code.md) — source-edit rules
  (commenting discipline, import-wildcard ban with rn-primitives
  exception). Applies to any `app/**`, `components/**`, `hooks/**`,
  `lib/**`, `types/**`, `electron/**`, or `scripts/**` work.

Code work also draws on
[`docs/implementation/lessons-learned/`](./docs/implementation/lessons-learned/README.md)
— indexed implementation pitfalls and runtime gotchas. Check the
index before touching the substrate an entry references.

Add new topic files (`testing.md`, etc.) when patterns emerge in
those domains.
